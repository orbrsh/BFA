<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>The Texas Civil War Centennial Commission has long felt the
need for a booklet setting forth a brief history of Texas&rsquo; participation
in the Civil War and the Confederacy. Many requests for such a
publication have come from schools, organizations and individuals.</p>
<p>We are proud to present &ldquo;Texas in the Civil War&rdquo; and feel that it
will lead to an understanding of the true story of this period of Texas
history.</p>
<p>We are especially indebted to Dr. Allan C. Ashcraft, who prepared
&ldquo;Texas in the Civil War&rdquo; at no cost to our Commission. Mr. James
Wilkins of Tyler contributed the art work. A chronology appears on
page 45 and was prepared by the Committee on Chronology. Professor

<br />A R&Eacute;SUM&Eacute; HISTORY</h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 class="center" id="c3">TEXAS IN 1860</h3>
<p>Texas in 1860 was an area where the Old South faded into what was
to become the new West. The state was a partially settled land of
contrasts surrounded by enemies on all but the Louisiana side.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
This one friendly boundary was a powerful tie that linked Texas both
physically and psychologically with its Southern parent lands.</p>
<p>Because the state was in an early phase of settlement, the population
of 420,891 white persons included a great majority of people who had
been born in other states or in foreign countries. Barely one-third of
the whites had been born in Texas, while over ten percent of them were
originally from countries other than the United States. Most of the settlers
from other states were from the South.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> Thus far these
hardy individuals had organized counties along the entire length of
the Rio Grande and, elsewhere, as far west as the 100th meridian frontier
line.</p>
<p>Within the main settled portion could be found several distinctive
agricultural regions. The principal center of the cotton plantation
system was in a cluster of a half-dozen counties that touched the
coast in Matagorda and Brazoria counties, and included the best soil
in the Gulf Plains. Much cotton was also raised in the Brazos, Colorado,
and Trinity river bottoms. Most of the state&rsquo;s Negro population
(182,566 slaves and 355 free Negroes) lived in the vicinity of these
heavy cotton producing counties. To the north and east of the plantation
centers was an area of agricultural diversity. Cotton was raised
as a &ldquo;cash crop&rdquo;, while grains and vegetables were grown for local
consumption. Northwest and west of the cotton lands was a subsistence
agricultural belt that extended to the frontier. Here, strong men
fought marauding Indians and contended with periodic drought in an
effort to make a meager living for their families. Finally, to the southwest
of the plantations was cattle country, where almost four million
unmarketable beeves roamed the open ranges from the San Antonio
River to the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>The agrarian nature of 1860 Texas is well reflected in the fact
that less than five percent of the population lived in urban areas.
There were fifty-two incorporated towns (settlements of over 1,000),
of which only San Antonio and Galveston exceeded the 5,000 mark.
Other points of minor population concentration were scattered villages
and a score of Federal military forts that were situated along the Rio
Grande and near the frontier line.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<h3 class="center" id="c4">POLITICS, SECESSION, AND WAR</h3>
<p>In state politics Texas was divided between a loosely organized
Democratic Party and the followers of Sam Houston. Houston&rsquo;s strong
anti-sectional views cost him the gubernatorial election in 1857. Two
years later, however, the aging hero of San Jacinto capitalized on a
general reaction against sectional extremists and was elected governor
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
on a nationalist platform. When Abraham Lincoln won the Republican
presidential nomination in 1860, Governor Houston urged his
fellow Texans to keep cool heads and to avoid taking drastic steps
that might later be regretted.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In the national election of November, 1860, the voters of the Lone
Star State cast a three to one majority for John C. Breckinridge
(Southern Democrat) over John Bell (standard bearer of the conservative
Constitutional Union Party.) The names of Lincoln and Stephen
A. Douglas (Northern Democrat) did not appear on Texas ballots.
When it was learned that the Republican candidate had won the
presidency, Texans, like other Southerners, went into mourning and
many replaced United States flags with state banners. Then, when
other states of the South called for secession conventions, Texans
demanded that the same action be taken in their state.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Governor Houston managed to block all secession calls until December,
when Attorney General George M. Flournoy, Associate Justice
O. M. Roberts of the State Supreme Court, and lawyer William P.
Rogers and John S. Ford took the lead in calling for a state-wide election
of secession convention delegates to meet in Austin on January
28, 1861. A subsequent statement explaining this move cited a Texas
Constitutional provision that the people &ldquo;have at all times the unalienable
right to alter, reform, or abolish their form of government&rdquo;
as a source of authority for the convention call.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> It was also at this
time that the voters of Texas were promised a popular referendum on
the secession assembly&rsquo;s work; and of the original seven Confederate
states, Texas was the only one to hold such an election on the question
of secession. Seventy-two prominent citizens, including Lieutenant
Governor Edward Clark, signed this second call.</p>
<p>As provisions for the forthcoming election of delegates were being
made, Sam Houston called for a special session of the legislature to
meet on January 21. The Governor desperately hoped to use the legislative
body to neutralize the work of the convention. But this remote
possibility was stifled when the House and the Senate promptly adopted
an anti-Houston attitude and enthusiastically welcomed the assembling
convention.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>On Monday. January 28, 1861, the secession delegates organized under
the presidency of Judge O. M. Roberts. As late comers kept arriving,
the body eventually came to number one hundred seventy-six
members. Elected from state legislative districts, the delegates were
mainly lawyers, planters, and farmers.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> In short order a heavy majority
approved a resolution to withdraw Texas from the Union, and an
Ordinance of Secession was passed by a vote of 166 to 7. This ordinance
basically charged that the United States government had failed
to meet its responsibilities under the &ldquo;compact of Union.&rdquo; Specifically,
it was asserted that Federal authority had neglected to give &ldquo;protection
either to the persons of our people upon an exposed frontier, or to the
property of our citizens.&rdquo; The document also condemned the Northern
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
states for attempting to make the central government into &ldquo;a weapon
with which to strike down the interests and prosperity of the people
of Texas and her Sister Slaveholding States.&rdquo; Therefore, concluded
the Ordinance, the people of Texas chose to withdraw from the Union
and to reclaim all sovereignty delegated to the Federal government
when Texas joined the United States.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The convention established a Committee of Public Safety to oversee
security matters while the main delegation recessed to await popular
approval of secession. Just before being disbanded until March 2, the
Austin assembly named seven representatives<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> to the Montgomery,
Alabama, convention of the seceding states. These men were to journey
to Alabama where they would speak for Texas in the forming of the
new Confederate government.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> With his hand thus forced, Governor
Houston ordered an election to be held on February 23 to determine
whether or not the Secession Convention&rsquo;s work would be approved by
the people.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Shortly before this election was held, the Committee of Public
Safety decided that for purposes of state security the almost 3,000
Federal soldiers stationed in Texas must be surrendered. This delicate
matter was settled on February 15, when the followers of Colonel Ben
McCulloch suddenly surrounded military departmental headquarters
in San Antonio. McCulloch&rsquo;s strong show of force was sufficient to
cause the bloodless surrender of Brevet Major General David E.
Twiggs&mdash;aged commander of all United States forces in the state. According
to the terms of his capitulation, Twiggs was to evacuate his
soldiers and turn over all station property to the state.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>A week later in the midst of fiery editorials and heated discussions.
the mandate on secession was held and county results were forwarded
to Austin. On March 2, the anniversary of Texas independence, the
Secession Convention re-assembled to canvass the result of the election.
Because a quorum was lacking, however, this task had to be postponed
until Monday, March 4.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> Of the one hundred twenty-two
counties reporting, only nineteen, located mainly in northern Texas or
along the middle of the frontier line, showed a preference to stay with
the Union. In overall figures, secession was endorsed by a vote of 46,129
to 14,697. When these results were certified to the convention.
President Roberts proclaimed Texas to be &ldquo;a free, sovereign and independent
nation of the earth.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> Later that same day a disgruntled
Governor Houston officially admitted to his people that a large majority
had favored secession.</p>
<p>The convention next considered the complex problem of defending
Texas, and at the same time, rushed instructions to the Texas delegation
in Montgomery, Alabama, to secure admission of the state to
the Confederacy. Sam Houston, when he learned of these actions,
charged that the convention was completely overstepping its authority.
To counter such protests, the determined secession delegates developed
a plan that would ultimately cause Houston to remove himself from
office. A resolution was passed requiring all high state officials to
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
swear allegiance to the Confederacy at noon on March 16. When Houston
failed to appear at the oath-taking ceremony, the convention declared
his office to be vacant. Pro-secessionist Lieutenant Governor
Edward Clark assumed the gubernatorial position for the nine months
remaining in Houston&rsquo;s term. Finally, with its work accomplished, the
Texas Secession Convention adjourned <i>sine die</i> on March 26.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Confederate States government had been organized
and Judge John H. Reagan of Texas was named Postmaster General.
In late April news reached Texas that Fort Sumter had been fired on.
With war between the sections now a reality, Governor Clark promptly
set about gearing the state for military action. Measures were taken
to capture as prisoners of war all federal troops who had been surrendered
by General Twiggs and who were still in the process of leaving
the state.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> Also, the Governor asked for 3,000 volunteers to supplement
several existing regiments that had been called into service by the
Secession Convention. Later in April, Clark called for an additional
8,000 volunteer infantrymen to serve the South.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Not all Texans were confident that the state had been wise in seceding
and in joining the Confederacy. German settlers in the San Antonio-Fredericksburg-New
Braunfels areas were especially disturbed
over the turn of events. They had never accepted the idea of slavery
and they now came to be looked on with distrust when some of their
numbers elected to leave the state. A group of North Texans similarly
decided to abandon their homes for the security of the United States.
Still other malcontents, who wished to escape from the Confederate
government or the dangers of war, moved to the Far West or across
the Mexican border.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<h3 class="center" id="c5">MOBILIZATION: EVENTS OF 1861</h3>
<p>Throughout 1861 Governor Clark issued calls for more troops and
worked to bolster state defenses. By September Texas had ten regiments
in Confederate service or in the process of being organized. Several
of these units were in Virginia, while the rest were standing by to
secure the state from possible invasion.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The forming of companies was seldom a smooth procedure. For one
thing, all Texans wanted to fight on horseback, but the Confederate
army already had sufficient cavalrymen and now needed only foot
soldiers. Also, the Southern leaders wanted men to serve for the war&rsquo;s
duration, but most volunteers were reluctant to sign up for more than
twelve months. While these requirements tended to make young men
feel less enthusiastic about serving their country, the state government
was seriously hampered in its recruiting operations by an over-anxious
Confederate War Department. Richmond kept sending heavy troop
levies to the Governor while also authorizing private persons to carry
out their own recruiting programs. This resulted in serious recruiting
competition between the state and the Confederate officers. In several
cases units ear-marked to meet state troop requirements were marched
away by &ldquo;recruiting colonels.&rdquo; Despite Governor Clark&rsquo;s protest, this
problem continued to exist for many months.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>A typical example of the mechanics of forming a unit took place at
Marshall in April, 1861, when organization of the W. P. Lane Ranger
Company was announced. Volunteers were expected to supply their
own mounts while the state agreed to furnish arms. On the appointed
day the young men were massed in the center of the town, had their
horses examined for serviceability, elected their officers, and were
given an oath of allegiance to Texas by a local judge. The rest of the
day was spent in preparing the unit&rsquo;s roll of members and in attending
a special church service. The next morning saw the company reassembled
in the town square, awaiting the presentation of a flag that
had been made by the young ladies of Marshall. After a long and flowery
presentation speech, the banner, reported to have measured six
by fifteen feet, was accepted by the unit. Then, at noon, amidst tears
and kisses, the company took up the march to its destiny. A few miles
down the road, however, destiny was delayed while the men were
feasted at a local college. By dusk the badly scattered soldiers straggled
to a camping site and dined on delicacies that had been brought
from home. The Rangers were feted, lauded, and blessed in almost
every town through which they passed. Late in May they arrived in
San Antonio where they were armed, mustered into Confederate service
as Company &ldquo;F&rdquo; of the Second Texas Mounted Rifles, and assigned
to patrol duty on the state&rsquo;s frontier.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>As more regiments were formed, a growing scarcity of firearms caused
grave concern. A few units solved this difficulty by demanding
that the enlistees secure weapons on their own initiative. By using
this system Captain Strobel&rsquo;s Company of Terry&rsquo;s Texas Rangers
could boast that each of its men carried a double barrel shotgun, a
six-shooter, and an issued &ldquo;Texas tooth-pick.&rdquo; This last item was described
as a &ldquo;two edged pointed knife, 24 inches long, and weighing
about three pounds, and a man using it could cut another man&rsquo;s head
off and not half try.&rdquo; Most companies, however, relied on the state
to furnish arms. By summer, 1861, Texas had issued almost all of the
weapons that it owned.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Because of the increasing scarcity of guns, Governor Clark adopted
a policy of keeping the remaining state-owned weapons within the
confines of Texas. Future troops mustered into Confederate service
would have to draw arms from the Richmond government. Clark also
sent agents to Mexico, Cuba, and Europe in a near fruitless effort to
make contracts for the purchase of foreign guns. The state likewise
encouraged the establishment of local arms factories and powder
plants.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> Such things as military clothing, blankets, and messing equipment
would have to come from the penitentiary cloth mills at Huntsville,
from private donations through county soldiers&rsquo; relief agencies,
through trade with Mexico, or from Confederate supply depots.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>By fall, 1861, the security of Texas was being jeopardized by Indian
depredations along the frontier, by danger of invasions from the north
or by way of the coast, and by the possibility of violence along the
Mexican border. Repeated dispatches received in Austin reported
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
fierce Indian raids centering in the Brown-Gillespie County area. Also,
rumors had it that the Union was preparing a force in Missouri that
would momentarily undertake an invasion into Texas. Proof of the
United States forces having overrun Missouri was seen when pro-secessionist
Governor C. F. Jackson and Lieutenant Governor T. C.
Reynolds arrived with the Seal of the State of Missouri and set up a
temporary government at Marshall, Texas. Governor Clark took so
seriously the threat of a Union thrust into Texas that he expressed
his concern to President Jefferson Davis and declared that his state
stood ready to assemble 4,000 cavalrymen if it became necessary to
block such a move on the part of the enemy. In the same letter to
Richmond, Clark indicated a fear that West Texas might be faced with
a Union column coming through New Mexico. To defend this approach
and to safeguard the frontier from further Indian raids, legislative
approval was secured to organize a Frontier Regiment of ten
companies.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Texans were likewise fearful of invasions or raids along the coastline,
which could be discouraged by building fortifications and by stationing
garrisons at such key points as Sabine Pass, Pass Cavallo (in
Matagorda County). Port Aransas, and Galveston.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> Continuous Union
naval activity off Galveston caused that island to be regarded as a
critical invasion objective. In fact, so serious was this threat that emergency
plans were prepared for a quick evacuation of the city and possible
destruction of the railroad bridge that linked the island with the
mainland.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>As Union craft tightened the blockade of Texas port towns, the main
unblocked trade route from Texas to the outside world came to be the
overland trail from San Antonio to Matamoros. This Mexican town
contained a number of merchant houses that were willing to exchange
valuable Texas cotton for goods needed by the South. To safeguard
this supply route, to control border violence, and to intercept shirkers
and Unionists attempting to cross the Rio Grande, Texas kept a number
of state troops on patrol duty along the international river.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>In spite of these manifold dangers and wartime conditions, Texas
politics continued as usual. In November, 1861, an exciting contest
allowed Francis R. Lubbock to replace Edward Clark as governor.
Lubbock had wide political experience in the Lone Star State and,
once assured of his narrow victory, he made a quick trip to Richmond
to consult with principal Confederate leaders.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></p>
<h3 class="center" id="c6">CAMPAIGNING: 1862</h3>
<p>Throughout the early mobilization period Texans were anxiously
observing the invasion of New Mexico by Lieutenant Colonel John R.
Baylor and three hundred men of the Second Texas Rifles. As the
summer of 1861 passed, the Baylor force pushed scattered Federal defenders
northward along the upper Rio Grande.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> Despite this early
success, the Texas commander made it clear to leaders of the South
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
that he would need many more soldiers to hold these gains. Southern
control of the Arizona-New Mexico territory would increase the Confederate
land area, it would give the new government access to rich minerals
and poorly guarded Union supply dumps, it would secure western
Texas from invasion, and it would give the South ownership of the
Old Santa Fe Trail gateway to the Far West.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>To strengthen Baylor&rsquo;s position, Brigadier General Henry H. Sibley
organized three regiments in San Antonio and proceeded to Fort Bliss
in December, 1861. In the meanwhile, a deeply concerned Union War
Department rushed forces from California and Colorado to bolster
sagging Federal defenses in upper New Mexico. Sibley cut his way to
Albuquerque and Santa Fe before these Union relief columns could
arrive on the scene. During the battle at Apache Canyon, a United
States detachment destroyed the Confederates&rsquo; supply train. This disaster
plus the intelligence the Federal relief columns were converging
on him from two directions caused Sibley to order a withdrawal to
southern New Mexico.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
<p>This retreat quickly degenerated into a rout, however, as the sick,
hungry, and hard-pressed Texans straggled towards El Paso. In all,
General Sibley lost over half of his 3,000 men in the withdrawal that
ended only after the Union had seized the western tip of Texas. The
United States kept patrols and small garrisons in the Davis Mountain
region of the state and in El Paso throughout the remaining years of
the war.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Union successes in Arkansas in March of 1862 again reminded Texans
of the dangers they faced from invasions through that state. The
Federal victory at Pea Ridge, where Confederate Brigadier General
Ben McCulloch of Texas was killed, opened the way for United States
troops to advance on Fayetteville.</p>
<p>To neutralize this threat, Governor Lubbock had several state regiments
shifted to Tyler where they could act as guard forces to blunt
Union thrusts.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> Yet, as this precaution was being taken, the sudden
fall of New Orleans and ever increasing United States naval activities in
the Gulf caused Texans again to cast anxious eyes on their vulnerable
coastline. In May, Galveston was partially abandoned under the threat
of Union gunboat bombardment that never materialized.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> Several
months later Corpus Christi withstood a four day shelling by three
Federal ships.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>October saw an overpowering flotilla of eight enemy craft secure
the surrender of Galveston Island. With the loss of Galveston, Governor
Lubbock sealed off the entire bay area and called for 5,000 volunteers
to defend the main coastline. In issuing this call, Lubbock declared
that &ldquo;The crisis of the war seems to be at hand in Texas, and
we must prepare to defend our homes, or be driven from them with insult
and degradation, and all the horrors of rapine and violence.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></p>
<p>Some five hundred Massachusetts soldiers occupied Galveston while
Union Major General N. P. Banks ordered several strong regiments
to be transferred from Louisiana to this Texas toe-hold.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> Before
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
these reinforcements could embark for Galveston, however, Major General
John B. Magruder, recently named commander of the Confederate
Military District of Texas, instituted a lightening stroke to regain
the island for the South. He called for volunteers from Sibley&rsquo;s veterans
and a number of militia companies to mass at Virginia Point.
Then in the early hours of January 1, 1863, two converted gunboats,
the <i>Neptune</i> and the <i>Bayou City</i>, attacked the United States fleet
while Magruder, whose men had crept across the railroad bridge, attacked
the Galveston wharves. Within a matter of minutes the attack
ended in marked success. The Texans took three Federal ships
and over three hundred and fifty prisoners. Galveston was once more
under the Stars and Bars.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>In various actions during the first two years of the war, Texans
took a number of prisoners of war. These men had to be held in custody
until arrangements could be made for their exchange. Some of
the prisoners were kept in &ldquo;prison canyon&rdquo; near Camp Verde in Kerr
County. There was a pit-like gully where Union soldiers were allowed to
build shacks and to get adequate exercise with little risk of escape.
At one time this crude system held six hundred inmates.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>A much larger and better equipped prison was Camp Groce, near
Hempstead. Prisoners were housed in four long rows of rough barracks
that were described as &ldquo;enclosed cowsheds.&rdquo; Because of open
country to the north and much military patrol activity to the south,
few prisoners attempted to escape from Camp Groce.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>The largest prison in the state was Camp Ford, four miles northeast
of Tyler. Eventually it consisted of ten acres enclosed by a stockade
of eighteen foot logs. Prisoners made dugout shelters on a
hillside and roofed these &ldquo;shebangs&rdquo; with split logs. About 5,000 men
were held in confinement there when the prison was operating at
maximum capacity.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>The Confederate Congress, in April of 1862, passed its first conscription
act. Although Texas now had fifty-five regiments formed,<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a>
all able-bodied young men from eighteen to thirty-five (the age limits
were later repeatedly raised) would henceforth be subject to the
draft.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> Indignation against this act caused many protests to be heard
in areas that were unenthusiastic about the war. Strongest anti-conscription
feeling centered in Gillespie County. In fact, the German
settlers near Fredericksburg went so far as to form a five hundred
man Union Loyal League to defy the draft and to promote sympathetic
feelings for the United States. To suppress this subversive group,
Dunn&rsquo;s and Freer&rsquo;s state militia companies took control of the town,
declared martial law, and gave the citizens six days in which to take
an oath of loyalty to the South. Most Germans peacefully complied
with this requirement, a few troublemakers were arrested for a short
time, and a small number of incorrigibles quietly fled to Mexico.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>Occasionally pro-Union refugees would make their way to occupied
New Orleans, where they could enlist in Judge E. J. Davis&rsquo; First Regiment
of Texas United States Volunteers. As this unit grew in size,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Texas officials came to fear that it might be used in the execution of
raids on the state. One embittered Houston editor, in publishing the
facts on Davis&rsquo; command, stated &ldquo;let these refugee traitors set foot on
the soil of Texas, whether as mounted or unmounted riflemen, and
their blood will wash out their treason.... God grant that their carcasses
may all enrich the soil their lives have cursed!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
<p>As passive signs of disloyalty continued to exist, Confederate military
and state civil officials decided to cope with Unionism in an
overpowering fashion. In mid-1862 martial law was declared over the
entire state. Every alien and all native white males over sixteen were
to register and to answer the questions of county provost marshals.
People were required to have passes to cross county lines. Severe punishments
were set for those who attempted to depreciate Confederate
currency. Finally, those suspected of disloyalty were to be expelled
from their counties&mdash;presumably to settle in some other county and
conform, or else, to be driven from county to county until they left
the state. Unfortunately for the proponents of this stern policy, the
martial law decree was not approved by Richmond. That fall President
Jefferson Davis declared it to be an unwarranted assumption of power
and revoked the entire program.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>During the first two years of the war, the state government and the
people at home diligently struggled to supply Texas regiments with
the essentials of life. Prison made cloth, contributed items of clothing,
and special county tax funds and bond sale receipts were forwarded to
needy companies.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> As for the care of the sick and wounded Texans,
the financially embarrassed state passed heavy appropriations for the
establishment and support of special hospitals for Texas casualties in
various parts of the South.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></p>
<h3 class="center" id="c7">TEXAS UNITS FIGHTING ELSEWHERE: 1861-1863</h3>
<p>While the leaders of Texas were busily concerned with the well being
of their own state, the men of Texas were actively serving the Confederate
cause elsewhere. From the very outbreak of the conflict Texas
units made proud names for themselves on all fighting fronts.</p>
<p>The Lone Star State was represented in northern Virginia by three
regiments in the brigade of John Bell Hood. This brigade was formed
at Dumfries, Virginia, in September of 1861, and consisted mainly
of the First Texas Infantry, the Fourth Texas Infantry, and the Fifth
Texas Infantry.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> After intensive training first under L. T. Wigfall,<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a>
and then under Hood, the Texans were baptised in fire at Elthan&rsquo;s
Landing, Virginia, in May of 1862. Hood&rsquo;s men had been ordered
to protect the Confederate retreat route from Yorktown to Richmond.
Suddenly, the Texans ran into a Union skirmish line of unknown
strength near the York River. In a running fight, the Texas
units chased the enemy for a mile and a half, taking forty prisoners.
Hood, frequently apologetic in his reports, mentioned that the density
of the forests had limited his movements to such a degree that he was
unable to take more captives.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>In June, Hood&rsquo;s Brigade was attached to Jackson&rsquo;s Corps. Particularly
at Gaines&rsquo; Mill the unit showed promise of its future greatness.
It overran fourteen Union artillery pieces and captured an entire
enemy regiment. The cost of these gains was not light, however, as
the Fourth Texas lost all of its field grade officers and the entire brigade
had five hundred and seventy casualties. General Jackson, on
later viewing the site of the Texans&rsquo; triumph, declared &ldquo;the men who
carried this position were soldiers indeed!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
<p>The brigade&rsquo;s next major action was at the Second Battle of the
Manassas in the last days of August, 1862. On the 29th, the Texans
engaged in a counter-attack that gained six Federal colors. An advance
on the following morning cost the Union a mile and a half of
ground and four artillery guns. Although Hood had been elevated to
the command of a division, he could proudly claim that the Texans&rsquo;
&ldquo;gallantry and unflinching courage&rdquo; were &ldquo;unsurpassed within the history
of the world.&rdquo; In this great struggle the Fifth Texas lost seven
color bearers.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
<p>Then, in September, the brigade gained even greater renown at
Antietam. At one point the Texans and one other brigade were pitted
against two full Union corps. Hood described the event as &ldquo;the most
terrible clash of arms, by far, that has occurred during the war. The
two little giant brigades of this [Hood&rsquo;s] division wrestled with this
mighty force, losing hundreds of their gallant officers and men but
driving the enemy from his position and forcing him to abandon his
guns on our left.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a> The division&rsquo;s rear guard action saved the Confederates
from near certain annihilation, but at the end of the Antietam
campaign only a fraction of the command could still be classed as &ldquo;effectives.&rdquo;
The Texas Brigade lost five hundred and sixty men out
of eight hundred and fifty-four present for duty. The First Texas lost
over eighty percent of its original two hundred and twenty-six members.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>The next large scale action in which the brigade participated was
at Gettysburg in July of 1863. During a series of attacks against Little
Round Top Mountain, the men found that &ldquo;as fast as we would break
one line of the enemy, another fresh one would present itself, the
enemy reinforcing his lines in our front from his reserves.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> The
fighting became so heated that the First Texas ran out of ammunition
and had to resort to emptying the cartridge boxes of fallen comrades
and enemy dead. When darkness fell on July 2, members of the command
piled rocks in front of themselves to protect their forward positions
on the slope of the hill. The Texans continued to hold the right
of Lee&rsquo;s line throughout July 3, while Pickett&rsquo;s great charge against
the Union center was broken and the Southern army was bloodily repulsed.
Over four hundred of Hood&rsquo;s men were casualties in this great
battle that marked &ldquo;the high tide of the Confederacy.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a></p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the great campaigning area of the Kentucky-Tennessee-Mississippi
region, Texas regiments were likewise prominent in
military campaigns of this first half of the war. At Shiloh, described
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
by Grant as &ldquo;the severest battle fought at the West during the war,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a>
Texas was represented by Terry&rsquo;s Texas Rangers (the Eighth Texas
Cavalry), the Second Texas Infantry, and the Ninth Texas Infantry.
On April 6, 1862, the Rangers shielded the Confederate left by scouting
and blocking enemy flanking sweeps. The next day they protected
artillery positions and stood by to lead a counter-attack that never
materialized.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> On the opposite extremity of the gray line the Second
Texas cut its way forward for two miles on the first day&rsquo;s fighting. It
captured an entire Union artillery battery and, in the vicinity of the
Hornet&rsquo;s Nest, it secured the surrender of Prentice&rsquo;s Sixth Union Division.
One-third of the members of the Second Texas were casualties
by the time General P. G. T. Beauregard ordered a general retreat
on April 7. Beauregard had assumed command of Confederate
forces after the death of General Albert Sidney Johnston of Texas in
the afternoon of the first day.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> Meanwhile, for two days the Ninth
Texas had spearheaded attacks of the Second Brigade, First Division,
of Bragg&rsquo;s Corps.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a></p>
<p>At Iuka, Mississippi, in September, 1862, Whitfield&rsquo;s Texas Legion
(twelve dismounted companies) and the Third Texas Cavalry (dismounted)
captured a Union battery after a one hundred and fifty yard
charge into the mouths of the guns. Then, as a Federal regiment
sought to flank them, the Texans redressed their line in such a way
as to force the new challengers back for several hundred yards. So
close was this combat that a company officer of the legion killed the
opposing regimental commander with a dragoon pistol. The Texas unit
lost almost one-quarter of its men.</p>
<p>One month later the Second Texas Infantry gained fame at Corinth,
Mississippi. For two days their courageous commander, Colonel
William P. Rogers, led charges against the enemy&rsquo;s heaviest fortifications.
Finally, Rogers managed to plant his regimental flag on the
wall of the inner works. Seconds later, however, the Texans were forced
to pull back before a Union counter-thrust. In the withdrawal Rogers
escaped about twenty paces when his body was riddled by hostile
fire. So brave had been this Southern leader that the United States
forces gave his body a worthy funeral with full military honors. The
Second Texas lost about half of its men in these two days.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></p>
<p>In the December battle at Stone&rsquo;s River (Murfreesboro), Tennessee,
a number of Texas organizations were attached to Bragg&rsquo;s army. Terry&rsquo;s
Texas Rangers, the Fifteenth Texas Cavalry, the Tenth Texas
Cavalry, the Eleventh Texas Cavalry, the Ninth Texas Infantry, the
Fourteenth Texas Cavalry, and Douglas&rsquo; Texas Battery were involved
in this conflict. The Rangers raided the enemy&rsquo;s rear and gained intelligence
while the rest of the Lone Star State units, except Maxey&rsquo;s
Ninth Infantry, were grouped together in Ector&rsquo;s First Brigade of
Hardee&rsquo;s Corps. The Tenth Texas Cavalry took three stands of enemy
colors and six artillery pieces, and the Eleventh Texas Cavalry captured
three batteries and drove the Union forces back for three miles.
The remaining Texas units participated in heavy fighting.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Then, in the spring and early summer of 1863, two Texas organizations,
the Second Texas Infantry and eleven companies of Waul&rsquo;s
Legion particularly distinguished themselves in the defense of Vicksburg.
When Grant&rsquo;s men closed in on the river town, the Second Texas
was charged with safeguarding the vital Baldwin&rsquo;s Ferry Road approach
to the Southerners&rsquo; line. This was judged to be &ldquo;the assailable
point of our lines; the face of danger; the post of honor; the key of this
portion of our works of defense.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> After preliminary probes against
the Texans&rsquo; positions, on May 22 the Union threw five regiments
against them. Colonel Ashbel Smith, the Second Texas regimental
commander, reported that during this horrible struggle &ldquo;my men
received the enemy with a most resolute fire; my cannon belched canisters:
my men made the air reel with yells and shouts as they saw
the earth strewn with the enemy&rsquo;s dead. One of the enemy&rsquo;s regiments
staggered and was thrown into utter confusion. Our men, too,
fell thick and fast; the detachment of cannoneers suffered particularly.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a>
At times during the days&rsquo; fighting, opposing infantrymen
were firing within five paces of each other. Cotton bags that had been
stacked to shelter the Confederates were torn open by Minie balls, and
as whisps of cotton floated through the air some were ignited by the
gunfire. In fact, these bits of burning fibre had to be snuffed out by the
Texans&rsquo; bare hands when they endangered the unit&rsquo;s ammunition supply.
As the unsuccessful Union attackers fell back that night, the Second
Texas, all but broken as a military organization, estimated that
five hundred United States dead were left on the ground before it.<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a></p>
<p>Beleaguered Vicksburg fell on July 4, but Colonel Smith could claim
that his unit was justifiably proud even in defeat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Second Texas Infantry achieved one victory&mdash;they utterly
destroyed any prestige which the enemy might have heretofore
felt when the soldiers they should encounter should be
Texans.... When the Second Texas Infantry marched
through the chain of the enemy&rsquo;s sentinels, the spirits of
most of the men were even then at the highest pitch of fighting
valor. Released from the obligation of their parole, and
arms placed in their hands, they would have wheeled about,
ready and confident.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also noteworthy in the great Vicksburg campaign was Waul&rsquo;s Texas
Legion, commanded by Colonel T. N. Waul. On May 22, all but two
of its companies were defending the outskirts of the town. As an
element of General S. D. Lee&rsquo;s Brigade, these Texans, &ldquo;Unprotected
by breastworks, ... were subject to the most galling fire, and well they
sustained the noble cause for which they fought, never relaxing, but
[fighting] with increased ardor, until the last of the enemy was prostrated
or driven from their sight.&rdquo; The loss was very severe, particularly
so in officers, every officer of the staff present being either killed
or seriously wounded.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> Later, when two Alabama regiments were
unable to take a heavily defended United States flag on a close-in
parapet, General Lee assigned the task to Waul&rsquo;s men. They &ldquo;moved to
the assault, retook the fort, drove the enemy through the breach they
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
entered, tore down the stand of colors still floating over the parapet,
and sent them to the colonel commanding the Legion, who immediately
transmitted it, with a note to General Lee.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> At the time of surrender,
Waul&rsquo;s unit had suffered almost seven hundred casualties at
Vicksburg and had lost more officers than all the other regiments of
the oversized division to which it was attached.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a></p>
<p>These were instances of but a few Texas units involved in several
major engagements. Elsewhere dozens of Lone Star State regiments
were proving their military prowess. Naturally not all units were as
outstanding as Hood&rsquo;s, but in the great majority of cases Texas organizations
performed in a very impressive manner.</p>
<h3 class="center" id="c8">ISOLATION OF THE SOUTHWEST: 1863</h3>
<p>Until the latter part of 1863 the Union was unable to hamper the
growing cotton traffic from Texas to Mexico. According to the United
States Navy Department, there were frequently several hundred ships
standing off the mouth of the Rio Grande depositing goods in the
Matamoros-Bagdad area and picking up Texas cotton for trans-oceanic
shipment. Before the war, scarcely a half-dozen vessels visited
these Mexican towns each year.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> Because the Rio Grande was an
international body of water, the Union was unable to blockade it. Foreign
vessels, claiming to be trading with Mexico, could not legally be
denied use of it. About the only way that this trade could be neutralized
was for a Federal force to seize the Texas side of the river and to
establish a patrol system to intercept all cotton haulers.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> Most cotton
for the Mexican trade was transported overland by ox wagon from
agricultural regions for distances of up to five hundred miles or more.
Convoys of three to fifteen ponderous wagons, well equipped with
food and water, would normally take about three months to complete
a round trip to the Rio Grande. Once across the river, the bales
would be exchanged for blankets, shoes, powder, and chemicals used
in the manufacturing and servicing of weapons of war.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>A small portion of Texas cotton was carried to the outside world by
blockade runners. When the Union tightened its blockade against the
southeastern part of the Confederacy, a number of runners shifted
their bases of operation to the less closely patrolled coast of Texas.
By 1863 Tampico, Vera Cruz, and Belize (British Honduras) had become
rendezvous areas for cotton runners and cotton purchasers.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a>
To gain maximum benefit from cargo space available in ships that were
to run the blockade, screw-jacks were used to compress the bales of
cotton into holds. It soon became a source of pride among stevedores
to force the greatest number of bales into a given ship. In fact
one unfortunate vessel was sunk when &ldquo;over-ambitious bale handlers
compressed the cargo through the bottom of the ship.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Weapons and ammunition continued to be critically short in Texas.
General Magruder, in 1863, estimated that 40,000 arms were needed to
defend the Department of the Trans-Mississippi West.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a> With only
a trickle of guns coming from outside sources, the state continued to
urge local craftsmen to produce them. A cartridge factory was set up
in the old land office building in Austin. Also in the capital city were
a cap factory and a state foundry. Another cap factory, that used home-made
machinery, was in Gillespie County. A limited number of firearms
were fabricated in Rusk (Whitescarver and Campbell Co.) and
near Tyler (Short, Biscoe and Co.) Elsewhere, tiny weapons shops
were busy in Dallas County, and in the towns of Columbia, Lancaster,
and Marshall.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a></p>
<p>The first half of 1863 saw campaigning in the Mississippi Valley that
was seriously to affect the future of Texas. United States forces sought
to wrest control of the great river from the Southerners. As Grant
maneuvered to take Vicksburg, northern Confederate stronghold on
the great river, Banks moved through Louisiana in preparation for an
onslaught against Port Hudson, lowest Mississippi River point still
held by the South. To scatter and confuse enemy defenders, Banks
advanced on Port Hudson in such a way as to endanger key points
in Louisiana.<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> These disruptive thrusts caused many Louisiana
planters to bring their slaves into Texas to escape possible capture.<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a>
Also, Banks&rsquo; probes caused many Texas regiments to be shifted to
Louisiana, where they were to assist in blocking Banks&rsquo; column.
Pyron&rsquo;s Regiment was one such Texas force. As it hurried from Galveston
towards Niblett&rsquo;s Bluff, on the Sabine River enroute to Louisiana,
a distinguished British military observer reported on the unit&rsquo;s
appearance as it paraded by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First came eight or ten instruments braying discordantly, then
an enormous Confederate flag, followed by about four hundred
men moving by fours&mdash;dressed in every variety of costume,
and armed with every variety of weapon; about sixty
had Enfield rifles; the remainder carried shot-guns (fowling
pieces), carbines or long rifles of a peculiar and antiquated
manufacture. None had swords or bayonets&mdash;all had six-shooters
and bowie knives.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, when Banks withdrew to the east of the Mississippi River
and proceeded to concentrate against Port Hudson, most Texas commands
in the area were shifted to the Red River Valley of northern
Louisiana.<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a></p>
<p>That summer the Union forces captured Vicksburg and Port Hudson,
thus gaining full control of the Mississippi River. By instituting
a very tight gunboat patrol system, the Union was able to transform
this river into a formidable barrier that cut the Southwest away from
other states of the Confederacy.<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> To size up the new situation Lieutenant
General Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Confederate
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Department of the Trans-Mississippi West, called for a conference
with the governors of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri. The
meeting was held at Marshall in mid-August of 1863. The key question
to be discussed was that of Kirby Smith&rsquo;s powers. While the governors
showed a reluctance to admit it, the General would obviously have to
become virtual dictator of the isolated trans-Mississippi region. Only
in that way could the states involved gain the vital strength in leadership
that would allow them to remain undefeated. Tacit recognition
of Kirby Smith&rsquo;s need for extensive control was indicated by the governors&rsquo;
agreement that he should supervise all defenses and oversee all
future cotton transactions with Mexico.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
<p>As the Marshall Conference was in progress, the Union War Department
ordered an invasion of Texas. In view of French gains against
the Juarez government of Mexico, General Banks was told that &ldquo;there
are important reasons why our flag should be restored in some points
of Texas with the least possible delay.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a> Left to his own discretion
as to the exact point of attack, Banks decided to land an expedition at
Sabine Pass. The main defense of the Pass was an unimpressive
earthwork named Fort Griffin which commanded the narrows about
one and a half miles below Sabine City. The fort had six guns and
was manned by Company &ldquo;F&rdquo; of the First Texas Heavy Artillery. This
particular unit, under Captain F. H. Odlum and Lieutenant Dick
Dowling, was composed of Irish stevedores who had been recruited in
Houston and Galveston.</p>
<p>At midnight on September 6, a sentry sighted ship signals off the
coast. Because the company commander was absent, Dowling assumed
command of the fort. By mid-morning a fleet of twenty-two transport
ships and five gunboats was standing off Sabine Pass. On board
the vessels was an invasion force of 5,000 men. Until the following
dawn the ships stood off the narrows, and then the shelling of Fort
Griffin commenced. Dowling, who wished to draw the enemy closer,
offered no fire in response. Finally, when three of the enemy gunboats
had been lured to within a very close range, the Confederate cannoneers
opened with a tremendous barrage of fire. In forty-five minutes the
battle ended with Dowling the complete victor. His guns sank two
gunboats, damaged one, and drove off the remaining ships. He took
three hundred and fifty prisoners, killed almost one hundred men, and
gained a number of Federal weapons and supplies. No injuries were
suffered on the Southern side, although some of Dowling&rsquo;s guns were
almost ruined by the heat of the rapid firing. The men of the company
were highly honored for this success, and their incredible victory
served to boost the morale of Texas and of the Confederate
cause.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a></p>
<p>Several months later, a second plan by Banks to take Sabine Pass by
an overland march from Louisiana was ruled out due to communication
difficulties. Then, in November, the determined Banks succeeded
in landing 7,000 troops, including a Negro regiment, on the Brazos de
Santiago bar at the mouth of the Rio Grande. When Brigadier General
Hamilton P. Bee learned of this at his headquarters in nearby
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Brownsville, he realized that his 1,200 soldiers could not defend the
city. So, on November 3, 1863, Bee and his men evacuated the burning
border town.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> With the Matamoros trade route thus closed by the
Union seizure of Brownsville, cotton for Mexico would now have to
be hauled either through Laredo, two hundred thirty-five miles upstream
from Brownsville, or through Eagle Pass, ninety miles up the
river from Laredo. As for continuing the occupation of the Rio Grande
Valley, Union commanders agreed that such an effort would involve
the use of an unjustified number of regiments.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a></p>
<p>Elsewhere along the coast, Union troops were similarly active. By
the end of 1863 the Federals had limited forces at Corpus Christi,
Mustang Island, Pass Cavallo, Saint Joseph&rsquo;s Island, Indianola, and
Port Lavaca. Except for Galveston the enemy controlled the principal
coastal towns of the state.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a> But, as Confederate officers and state
leaders called for more men and desperately planned to regain Texas
ports, high strategic considerations in Washington caused the Union to
evacuate most of the occupied coast. It was again a matter of tying
up too many regiments, forces that would be needed in 1864 for a
massive invasion of the Red River Valley, an action that might well
cause the fall of the whole southwest.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a> Gradually the invaders withdrew
until the only force remaining on the coast was a strong command
located near Brownsville.</p>
<p>Near the end of 1863 the Texans again held a gubernatorial election.
When the able Lubbock announced that he would not seek office
again, the contest was between Pendleton Murrah and T. J. Chambers.
In a dull campaign the ailing Murrah easily won.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
<h3 class="center" id="c9">BEGINNING OF THE END: 1864</h3>
<p>The western frontier of Texas was again being ravaged by Indian
raids in 1864. The Frontier Regiment still existed; but, once it was
accepted into Confederate service, all but four of its companies were
transferred to East Texas. These four companies and a small command
known as Bourland&rsquo;s Border Regiment, stationed near the Red
River, simply could not safeguard the state&rsquo;s extensive line of settlement
against heavy Indian attacks.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> In one raid six hundred Comanches
and Kiowas depredated the Elm Creek locality in Young County.<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a>
The only help that the Texas government could offer the hard-pressed
frontiersmen was advice to &ldquo;fort up&rdquo; for security. In explaining
this means of defense, a state general order stressed the need for
&ldquo;getting together &amp; building blockhouses and stockade to live in. Four,
five, or more families might get together in this way, &amp; thus insure
the safety of the women &amp; children.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> Buck Barry, an experienced
Indian fighter, described an ideal stockade as four houses fenced together
with picket logs and featuring two log bastions on opposite corners
to allow sharpshooters to cover all approaches.<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> Until well after
the end of the great sectional struggle, Texas frontier families relied on
this passive defensive means during frequent periods of Indian unrest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>With the arrival of spring, 1864, the Federals commenced an invasion
up the Red River that was expected to penetrate into Texas.
Again General Banks had charge of the expedition. This time his
forces moved up the Red River while another Union column pushed
southward through Arkansas. The objective of both Federal armies was
Shreveport. By late March, General Kirby Smith had received communications
that convinced him of the seriousness of these two enemy
columns. In all, the enemy forces were estimated to total 50,000 foot
soldiers and 8,000 cavalry troops. Major General Richard Taylor, in
command of Confederate forces in western Louisiana, and Major General
Sterling Price, Confederate commander in Arkansas, were both
instructed to pull back cautiously toward Shreveport before the Federal
advances. The two commanders were also warned to avoid heavy
clashes with the invaders unless success was sure to follow for the
Southerners.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> General Kirby Smith warned Governor Murrah of the
situation: &ldquo;It is my duty to advise you that your State, especially, in its
Northern Section, is threatened with immediate invasion, that the
means at my disposal are comparatively small and inadequate, and I
urge upon you the necessity of putting immediately every armed man
in Texas into the field.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>
<p>In answer to this situation, drastic means were taken to force
men into uniform. Shirkers were arrested and forced into military
service, and troops detailed to non-combatant jobs were returned to
active commands. Confederate regiments at guard positions in Texas
were shifted to Louisiana, while defense of the Gulf ports was left to
state soldiers.<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> In the meanwhile, Major General F. Steele and the
Union forces in Arkansas pushed across the Little Missouri River
to within two hundred miles of Banks, who had now secured Natchitoches,
Louisiana. Then, on April 8, 1864, as Banks&rsquo; invaders occupied
Pleasant Hill, Louisiana, and advanced to within three miles of Mansfield,
Louisiana, General Taylor committed his forces in a desperate
attempt to throw back the Federals. After a hard fought battle Banks&rsquo;
army was defeated and compelled to retreat to Pleasant Hill. Taylor&rsquo;s
men retained close contact with the retreating Federals and after
equally hard fighting on the second day, the Confederate commander
could report that the Union troops were undertaking a night withdrawal
to the Red River near Natchitoches. Later Southern reports claimed
a Union rout on the first day and a definite check on enemy counter-attack
on the second day.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a></p>
<p>When Union prisoners captured in this fighting were asked what had
caused their retreat, some of them claimed that it was &ldquo;them &lsquo;durned
Texans&rsquo; hollerin&rsquo; that scared them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a> Texas troops especially
enjoyed the capturing of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A regiment of New York Zouaves all dressed in red flannel
trousers, looking somewhat like ladies&rsquo; bloomers of later
times. They wore dainty red caps with tassels and made
a sight for the Texans to look at, and when they were marching
by and were halted, the Texas troops pretended to get
mad, swore because they had been compelled to fight women.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Some of them threw down their guns and declared that if
they were to fight any more women they would go home. The
Zouaves thought the Texas boys were in earnest and protested
loudly that they were not women.<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Banks eventually withdrew to Alexandria, barely saving his fleet,
which was almost stranded upstream by a sudden fall in the Red River.<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a>
Meanwhile, in late April, Price forced an enemy retreat in
Arkansas. At Poison Springs, Marks&rsquo; Mill, and Jenkins&rsquo; Ferry, General
Steele was repulsed and his command pressed northward. Thus, the
overall Union plan to converge on Shreveport was frustrated and Kirby
Smith&rsquo;s men had victoriously repulsed overwhelming numbers.</p>
<p>Although Richmond was delighted to hear this news, these successes
in the Trans-Mississippi West had a strange effect on the thinking of
Confederate leaders. President Jefferson Davis and the War Department
suddenly came to look on Kirby Smith&rsquo;s scattered, unpaid, and
poorly organized army of 30,000 men as a powerful source of reinforcements
for hard-pressed Confederate commands to the east of the
Mississippi River. Orders were issued for heavy portions of Kirby
Smith&rsquo;s army to cross the great river in August, 1864. At the last
moment, however, these plans were cancelled&mdash;partly because of the
near impossibility of the river crossing operation and partly because
of heated protests from General Kirby Smith. While the War Office
was justified in seeking relief for the divisions in the east, Kirby Smith
made it clear that his regiments were barely capable of securing the
Southwest. The loss of any appreciable number of men would spell
sure doom for his department.<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a></p>
<p>While Texas now seemed temporarily safe from military advances,
other signs of weakness were to be observed. Confederate paper dollars
came to be worth only twenty cents or thirty cents in specie. Texas
tried to correct this condition by issuing state treasury warrants, but
this paper likewise suffered a drastic drop in real value as the war
continued.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> The heavily indebted state pressed Richmond for payment
of defense claims; but unfortunately for Texas, these claims were
never honored.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a> As for cotton sales in Mexico, this one great source
of revenue for the Lone Star State was very poorly managed. Due to
conflicting rules set down by the Confederate government, by the departmental
commander, by the state military district commander, and
by the state civil government, the entire commerce was badly hampered.<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a>
Added to this were the manipulations of dishonest state and
Confederate purchasing and marketing agents. About the only successful
cotton brokers were those men who flaunted the laws and
smuggled bales across the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Other serious weaknesses in Texas were a continued scarcity of
weapons, a shortage of laborers that forced the Confederate authorities
to impress slaves, and refusals on the part of civilians to sell supplies
to the army that ultimately resulted in impressments.<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> As
for the citizens, they were oppressed by high taxes, inflation, and shortages
of basic necessities. By late 1864 shoes cost $30, watermelons sold
at $5 each, coffee brought $10 per pound when it was available, and one
woman reportedly paid $90 for a yard and a half of denim material.<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Salt was so scarce that many people dug up the floors of their smoke-houses
and leached the soil to regain the saline drippings. Toothbrushes
consisted of the chewed ends of twigs. Whole dishes were scarce and
were handled with loving care. Paper, quinine, and tea were almost impossible
to find.<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a> Finally, the overall unhealthy situation of the
times was aggravated by unconfirmed reports of Unionist uprisings in
the state, unwarranted speculation on future invasions of Texas, and
dozens of extremely wild rumors.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a></p>
<h3 class="center" id="c10">FIGHTING BEYOND TEXAS: 1863-1865</h3>
<p>After heavy losses at Gettysburg, Hood&rsquo;s Texas Brigade was shifted
to Tennessee in September of 1863. At Chickamauga, the First
Texas, Fourth Texas, and Fifth Texas charged through artillery and
small arms fire to push repeatedly against a determined enemy in well
protected positions. One company of the First Texas had only a single
officer and no men surviving as a result of the many days of fighting.
The First and Fifth Texas had fewer than one hundred men each
who were unscratched at this point of the campaign.<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a></p>
<p>In November, the Texans in Hood&rsquo;s Brigade marched off with Lieutenant
General James Longstreet to capture the Federal stronghold
at Knoxville. When this plan miscarried, Longstreet&rsquo;s army was compelled
to spend a miserable and austere winter in northeastern Tennessee.
With the spring thaws of 1864, the Texas Brigade again was
shifted to the Virginia front. Back in familiar surroundings, the battered
regiments struggled to withstand General Grant&rsquo;s hammering.
At the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and other prominent
Virginia engagements, the brigade continued to rely on bravery to compensate
for its lack of size.</p>
<p>The remaining months of the war saw the Texans manning a portion
of the Richmond line and then acting as a rear guard in April of
1865, when Longstreet&rsquo;s Corps tried to retreat to Danville. As the news
of the surrender was heard, the Texans were entrenching themselves
in the face of an impending attack. The three Texas regiments
had performed remarkable feats of arms and, on a number of occasions,
had been singled out by General Lee for praise. But again
the price of military fame had been staggering&mdash;the historian of Company
&ldquo;M&rdquo; of the First Texas made this all too clear when he recorded
that only six of the company&rsquo;s original one hundred and twenty-five
men were present at the surrender.<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, after Hood&rsquo;s Brigade marched off towards Knoxville in
late 1863, almost a dozen Texas units had remained behind to complete
the Chattanooga campaign. In Breckinridge&rsquo;s Corps were the
Sixth Texas Infantry, the Seventh Texas Infantry, the Tenth Texas
Infantry, the Fifteenth Texas Cavalry (dismounted), the Seventeenth
Texas Cavalry, the Eighteenth Texas Cavalry, the Twenty-Fourth
Texas Cavalry, the Twenty-Fifth Texas Cavalry, and Douglas&rsquo; Texas
Battery. Two other Texas cavalry regiments, the Eighth (Terry&rsquo;s Texas
Rangers) and the Eleventh, were assigned to Wheeler&rsquo;s Cavalry
Corps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>On November 24 and 25, the Texas regiments in Cleburne&rsquo;s Division
of Breckinridge&rsquo;s Corps engaged in bitter combat on Missionary
Ridge. As the center of the Confederate line was broken, Texas regiments
that had been making progress against the Union right were
commanded to fall back to Ringgold, Georgia, twenty miles away, and to
make a defensive stand there as the main Southern army pulled back
through that town. On November 26, the Texans were manning blocking
positions near Ringgold. Strenuous fighting there delayed Union
advance elements until General Braxton Bragg&rsquo;s main forces were safe.
At one time in this rear guard action, three Texas companies routed
&ldquo;an entire regiment, the Twenty-ninth Missouri (Federal), capturing
their colors and between 60 and 100 prisoners, and causing the attacking
brigade to withdraw.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> The Texans were tendered a vote of
thanks by the main army for their protective screening of the retreat.
Hiram B. Granbury, who had recently been given command of a brigade
of these Texas regiments, was promoted to the rank of brigadier
general for this action.<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a></p>
<p>Throughout 1864 the Texans were active in the fighting that took
place in northwestern Georgia and in the defenses of Atlanta. That
fall, the men of the Lone Star State were present when John Bell
Hood assumed command of the Army of Tennessee and instituted
his winter push back into Tennessee. At Franklin, Granbury&rsquo;s men
were all but wiped out in a series of unsuccessful assaults against Union
positions on November 30, Granbury being one of the killed. The
next morning not a single captain in the brigade was capable of performing
duty. The remnants of the shattered Texas regiments were almost
captured at Nashville when Union Major General George
Thomas&rsquo; pressure caused a break in the Southerners&rsquo; left and center.
As a rout-like withdrawal commenced, the Texans on the extreme right
were not given the word to fall back. When they discovered that the
rest of the army was retreating, the Texans fell back and were again
assigned the serious task of guarding the rear of the main force.<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a></p>
<p>After Hood&rsquo;s failure in Tennessee, command of the army was returned
to General Joseph Johnston in January, 1865. For the rest
of the war the Texans in Johnston&rsquo;s army fought in vain to arrest
Sherman&rsquo;s advance from Savannah into the Carolinas. At the time of
the surrender there were only about six hundred men in the eight
regiments that composed Granbury&rsquo;s old brigade. In one company
of the Eighteenth Texas Cavalry there were but five men left.<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a></p>
<p>Elsewhere, earlier in the war, Ross&rsquo; Cavalry Brigade had engaged
in extensive raiding operations in the Alabama-Mississippi-Tennessee
area. Ross&rsquo; command was composed of the Third Texas Cavalry, the
Sixth Texas Cavalry, The Ninth Texas Cavalry, and Twenty-Seventh
Texas Cavalry. After patrolling to the south of Vicksburg, the brigade
spent much of the remainder of 1864 harassing a large Union
force that shifted from the Mississippi Valley to the east, and in defending
Atlanta. While striving to delay United States advances
against Atlanta, the brigade averaged a fight a day for over three
months. Late that fall, Ross was ordered to support Hood&rsquo;s re-entry
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
into Tennessee. In raids of late November and December, Ross lost
over one hundred men; yet he captured over five times that number of
prisoners, he seized nine Federal colors, he relieved the enemy of a
great amount of equipment, he destroyed two fully loaded United States
railway supply trains, and he captured almost fifty supply wagons.
Ross&rsquo; Brigade ended the war again conducting patrol actions in Mississippi.<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a></p>
<p>Similarly active was Terry&rsquo;s Texas Rangers. After suffering forty
per cent casualties in the Chickamauga-Chattanooga struggles, the
Rangers so diligently carried out raids against Federal camps that
they crossed and re-crossed the Tennessee River on six different occasions
in the winter of 1863-64. After the fall of Atlanta and the
commencement of Hood&rsquo;s Tennessee campaign, the Rangers remained
in Georgia with Wheeler&rsquo;s Cavalry Corps&mdash;the only sizable unit left
to oppose Sherman&rsquo;s march across Georgia. When the Union army
reached Savannah and redirected its march into the Carolinas,
the Texans kept up their futile efforts to delay the advance of the
overpowering Federal forces. Finally, in April of 1865, at Greensboro,
North Carolina, the Texans learned of General Joseph Johnston&rsquo;s surrender.
In spite of this, a number of men agreed to evade their captors
and to flee westward in small groups to join Kirby Smith&rsquo;s army in
the Southwest. But by the time these men reached the Mississippi
River, news was heard of the surrender of all Confederate forces to
the west. Disappointed brigade members then realized the hopelessness
of their situation and disbanded.<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a></p>
<p>Texas contributed heavily to the Confederate military effort in terms
of manpower and in the area of leadership. It contributed one general,
Albert Sidney Johnston. It was the adopted home of a lieutenant
general, John Bell Hood. It furnished three major generals: S. B. Maxey,
John A. Wharton, and Tom Green. In addition there were thirty-two
brigadier generals and almost one hundred colonels.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a> As for
troop units, the Lone Star State supplied the Confederate army with
forty-five regiments of cavalry, twenty-three regiments of infantry,
twelve battalions of cavalry, four battalions of infantry, one regiment of
heavy artillery, and three light artillery batteries. Besides these units
mustered into Confederate service, Texas had many organizations
that remained under state control. A current listing of named Texas
units includes thirty artillery batteries, one artillery regiment, thirty-nine
cavalry battalions, sixty-one cavalry regiments, thirteen infantry
battalions, twenty-eight infantry regiments, and two legions.<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a> These
organizations fought in all parts of the South and their operations
ranged from Maryland to Arizona and from the Potomac River to the
Rio Grande. As for heroism, the state produced such outstanding regiments
as those of Hood&rsquo;s Brigade and such noted individuals as Lieutenant
Dick Dowling. In all, the men of Texas did their utmost to
support the Southern cause to which they had pledged their allegiance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h3 class="center" id="c11">THE BREAK-UP: 1865</h3>
<p>By spring, 1865, the soldiers of the trans-Mississippi region were
showing signs of the increasing defeatist feeling. A Union officer who
scouted widely in the Rio Grande valley reported that &ldquo;the demoralization
of the rebel army in Texas is very extensive. In all the counties
from San Antonio to Austin up to the mountains the rebel soldiers
are coming home in large numbers, and in two or three places have notified
the enrolling officer and provost-marshal that their services were
no longer needed.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a></p>
<p>But on the other hand, the Confederate government and General
Kirby Smith were taking extreme measures to keep the field forces intact.
In February, 1865, all non-fighting troop details were outlawed
except where soldiers were needed to keep a few key manufacturies in
operation, all white men from eighteen to forty-five were ordered to
report for immediate military service, and all leaves were cancelled.<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a>
Kirby Smith implored Richmond to make available the $50,000,000
in back pay due his men.<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a> All Confederate prisoners on
parole in Texas were declared to be exchanged and were commanded
to rejoin their units. Unauthorized absentees were promised pardons if
they returned to their companies within twenty days.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a> Once
more Federal invasion troops were moving up the Red River and
down from Arkansas. Only by thus scraping the bottom of the barrel
could Texas hope to keep the determined foe at bay.</p>
<p>In late April, 1865, just as a number of scandals involving illegal
seizures of privately owned cotton were coming to light, the word arrived
in Texas that General Lee had surrendered in Virginia. General
Kirby Smith and Governor Murrah quickly penned proclamations
asking the soldiers and citizens of the trans-Mississippi region to continue
the struggle. Murrah declared that &ldquo;These unforeseen calamities
imposed additional responsibilities on the State of Texas&rdquo; because
Southerners now looked &ldquo;with eager eyes and anxious hearts to the
people and armies of this Department, for rescue and deliverance.
They will not&mdash;they must not look in vain. With God&rsquo;s blessing, it
may yet be the proud privilege of Texas, the youngest of the Confederate
Sisters, to redeem the cause of the Confederacy from its present
perils.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a></p>
<p>But such inspiring words failed miserably to compensate for the
common realization that the Confederacy had failed. It could now be
seen that for many months past the Southwest had endured the war
in a desperate hope that Lee would soon achieve complete victory.
With this one great hope crushed, the entire department was too
demoralized to continue the fight. Desertions in very large numbers
followed. Oftentimes bands of ten and twenty men would leave their
undersized regiments in a single night. In Galveston, only the timely
calling out of faithful troops prevented the attempted desertion of
four hundred soldiers.<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>By May, surrender negotiations between Kirby Smith&rsquo;s representatives
and the United States government were in progress. It was at
this time that the last land action of the war took place in the isolated
Brownsville sector. In mid-May some eight hundred Union soldiers
were moving from their Brazos de Santiago base when they suddenly
made contact with several hundred of Colonel John S. Ford&rsquo;s Confederates
who were camped at White&rsquo;s Ranch. The Southerners had
heard nothing of Lee&rsquo;s surrender, but had been warned of the presence
of Union troops by French and Mexican observers on the south side of
the Rio Grande. The Federals quickly formed a skirmish line, pushed
against the Confederates, and then entrenched in the sandy soil of
Palmetto Ranch. As this occurred, Ford managed to position six artillery
pieces on Palmetto Hill and fired down into the United States
soldiers&rsquo; defensive works. This forced the superior Federal command to
retire from the field. In all, the Union lost over one hundred prisoners.
When these captives convinced Ford of Lee&rsquo;s surrender, the Texans
were so stunned that no pursuit of the retreating enemy soldiers
was attempted.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a></p>
<p>Finally, on May 26, Lieutenant General S. B. Buckner, Kirby
Smith&rsquo;s Chief of Staff, negotiated a &ldquo;military convention of peace&rdquo;
with high Union officials in New Orleans.<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a> This act was finalized
on June 2 when General Kirby Smith formally signed the articles of
surrender aboard the Union warship <i>Fort Jackson</i> in Galveston harbor.
In the same month Federal troops arrived to occupy Texas. To impress
French observers in Mexico, the Rio Grande was made a point of concentration
for occupation soldiers. A strange sight was seen in Galveston
on June 16 when the occupation officially started. Three hundred
silent Texans watched as a United States transport ship loaded with
soldiers was tied to the landing while a blue clad band played &ldquo;Yankee
Doodle.&rdquo; Three days later, on &ldquo;Juneteenth,&rdquo; Major General Gordon
Granger, recently named commander of Union forces in Texas, landed
at the same port and immediately issued a proclamation declaring
free all Texas slaves.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a> Eventually there were over 50,000 Federal
soldiers in Texas. Parts of Herron&rsquo;s Division occupied northeastern
Texas. Mower&rsquo;s Division occupied Galveston. Custer and 4,000 cavalrymen
occupied Austin. Merritt occupied San Antonio with an even
larger force of mounted men. Elsewhere the state was occupied by the
Fourth Corps, the Thirteenth Corps, and the Twenty-Fifth Corps.<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a></p>
<p>The war was at last over. Some Texans were able to express pleasure
that the end had finally come while others were not talking. A
few of the state&rsquo;s leaders during the war fled to Mexico. The solid
citizenry of the state faced the task of creating a respected state
government and an enduring nation. They faced this task with a firmness
of purpose that has characterized our citizens since the establishment
of the Republic of Texas.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
