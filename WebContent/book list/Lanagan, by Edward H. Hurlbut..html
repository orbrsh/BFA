<p class="drop-cap">JACK LANAGAN of the San Francisco <i>Enquirer</i>
was conceded to have &#8220;arrived&#8221; as the
premier police reporter of San Francisco. This
honour was his not solely through a series of brilliant
newspaper feats in his especial field, but as well
by reason of an entente that permitted him to call
half the patrolmen on the force by their given names;
enjoy the confidences of detective sergeants, a close-mouthed
brotherhood; dine tête-à-tête in private at
French restaurants with well-groomed police captains
on canvasback or quail out of season, and sit
nonchalantly on a corner of the chief&#8217;s desk and absent-mindedly
smoke up the chief&#8217;s two-bit cigars.</p>

<p>It was an intimacy that carried much of the lore
of the force with it: that vital knowledge not of
books. Bill Dougherty on the &#8220;pawnbroker detail&#8221;
knew scarcely more &#8220;fences&#8221; than did Lanagan;
Charley Hartley, who handled the bunco detail,
found himself nettled now and then when Lanagan
would pick him up casually at the ferry building
and point out some &#8220;worker&#8221; among the incoming
rustics whom Hartley had not &#8220;made,&#8221; and
debonair Harry O&#8217;Brien, who spent his time among
the banks, was more than once rudely jarred when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Lanagan would slip over on the front page of the
<i>Enquirer</i> a defalcation that had been engaging
O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s attention for a week.</p>

<p>So it went with Lanagan; from the &#8220;bell hops&#8221;
of big hotels, the bar boys of clubs, down to the
coldest-blooded unpenned felon of the Barbary Coast
who sold impossible whiskey with one hand and
wielded a blackjack with the other, the police sources
were his.</p>

<p>Consequently Lanagan, having &#8220;arrived,&#8221; may
be accorded a few more liberties than the average
reporter and permitted to spend a little more time
than they in poker in the back room at Fogarty&#8217;s,
hard by the Hall of Justice. Here, when times were
dull, he could drift occasionally to fraternise with a
&#8220;shyster,&#8221; those buzzards of the police courts and
the city prisons who served Fogarty; or with one
of the police court prosecuting attorneys affiliated
with the Fogarty political machine, for Fogarty was
popularly credited with having at least two and possibly
three of the police judges in his vest pocket.
Or he could rattle the dice with a police judge himself
and get the &#8220;inside&#8221; on a closed-door hearing
or the latest complaint on the secret file; and he
could keep in touch with the &#8220;plain-clothes&#8221; men
who dropped in to pass the time of day with Fogarty;
or with the patrolmen coming on and off
watch, who reported to Fogarty as regularly as they
donned and doffed their belts and helmets things
they thought Fogarty should know.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>In this fashion does the police reporter best serve
his paper; for it is by such unholy contact that he
keeps in touch with the circles within circles of the
police department of a great city. Some he handles
by fear, some he wins by favour, some he wheedles.
In the end, if he be a brother post-graduate, the
grist of the headquarters&#8217; mill is his.</p>

<p>Of the shysters there is Horace Lathrop, for instance,
who boasts a Harvard degree when he is
drunk&mdash;never when he is sober.</p>

<p>Horace is sitting with Lanagan at Fogarty&#8217;s
rear room table, while Lanagan sips moodily at his
drink.</p>

<p>Larry the Rat, runner for the shysters, pasty of
face, flat of forehead as of chin, with an upper lip
whose malformation suggests unpleasantly the rodent
whose name he bears, shuffles in and bespeaks
Lathrop at length. That worthy straightens up,
glances at Lanagan, and then remarks:</p>

<p>&#8220;Casey has just brought in a moll,&#8221; and arises,
with elaborate unconcern, to leave the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Lanagan, &#8220;what else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. That&#8217;s all I know. Going to try to
get the case now, whatever it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you told him, Larry?&#8221; asked Lanagan.
The Rat mumbled unintelligibly and shuffled
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Rat&#8217;s answered after his breed,&#8221; said Lanagan.
&#8220;He says no, it is not. Now, Horace&mdash;pardon
me, Barrister Lathrop&mdash;kick through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
You know I&#8217;ve got to deliver a story to my paper
to-day. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan never wasted words with Lathrop.
There were a few trivialities that he &#8220;had&#8221; on that
individual. But Lathrop balked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Lanagan, all I got&#8217;s her name and
address. It isn&#8217;t square. She may have a roll as
long as your arm. You print this story, the newspaper
men go at her for interviews, tip her off about
me, she gets a regular lawyer, and where do I come
off? You fellows are always crabbing our game.
I gave you that shoplifter story a week ago and you
played it for a column. You know you did, Jack;
now you know you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lathrop had been whining. Now he stiffened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to,&#8221; defiantly; &#8220;I&#8217;m tired o&#8217; being
bullied by you. Aw, say now, Jack, it&#8217;s a big case.
And I got a wife and kids to look out for&#8221;&mdash;which
was a fact&mdash;&#8220;and here you come taking the
bread and butter out of their mouths. It ain&#8217;t
square, Jack; you know it ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>All morals to all men, reflected Lanagan, and
laughed lazily, pulling a copy of the <i>Enquirer</i> across
the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;See her, Horace? Right on this page&mdash;page
one, column two, right here, with your name in big
black-face letters&mdash;a little story of about one-third
of a column on that $750 touch-off on that Oroville
deacon, who went astray for the first time of his life
and was pinched as a drunk&mdash;to be fleeced by you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and your precious band. There isn&#8217;t any way of
getting his money back, or proving a case against
you or the two cops who cut the roll with you and
Fogarty. I didn&#8217;t print the story, but I&#8217;ve got the
facts pretty straight; and it goes right here&mdash;right
in this nice, conspicuous place for the grand jury to
see and for that wife and those &#8216;kids&#8217; to see also,
who, singular as it may sound, actually don&#8217;t know
what particular brand of a &#8216;lawyer&#8217; you are. Get
all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lathrop &#8220;got&#8221; it.</p>

<p>Lanagan was then told that the detinue cells held
a young woman of remarkable beauty, Miss Grace
Turner, taken from a family rooming house on
O&#8217;Farrell Street. Also that through Lathrop word
of her arrest was to be taken to her brother there.
Lathrop&mdash;or Larry the Rat, both being cogs in the
same machine&mdash;had come by the information by
the underground wire that runs from every city
prison to the bail-bond operators and their shysters
without.</p>

<p>Fogarty was the bail-bond chief, and possibly one
of the plain-clothes men who just now rested his
elbow upon the bar may have passed that name and
address to Larry the Rat.</p>

<p>The &#8220;detinue&#8221; cases are those on the secret book
at headquarters, that stable police violation of
Magna Charta; the detinue cases, therefore, become
the focus of the police reporter&#8217;s activity.</p>

<p>&#8220;And incidentally, Horace, you stay away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
1153A O&#8217;Farrell Street until I get through,&#8221; was
Lanagan&#8217;s final command.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about Fogarty?&#8221; whined the shyster.
&#8220;He must know by this time I got the case. You
know what he could do to me if he wanted to, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I know what I could do to him if I
wanted to, and he knows it, too,&#8221; snapped Lanagan.
&#8220;Leave him to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a friend of Miss Turner&#8217;s,&#8221; he said as the
landlady opened the door at 1153A O&#8217;Farrell. &#8220;I
wish to speak with her brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be glad to see you. He has been worrying.
You ain&#8217;t another one of them detectives? I
didn&#8217;t tell him, though. He was asleep and the doctor
said he shouldn&#8217;t be worried just now. It might
be fatal. What did they do with the poor, dear
girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely holding her for a few hours. What
was the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Giving a bad check to the druggist for medicine.
She did the same thing at the grocer&#8217;s. It&#8217;s
a dirty trick, I say, to arrest the poor thing. Why,
the grocer&#8217;s bill was only a few dollars. They don&#8217;t
eat enough to keep my canary. The man eats
mostly almonds. Something wrong with his stomach,
and that seems to be all he can eat. Funny,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The garrulous woman led Lanagan to a doorway
in the rear. He knocked and, in response to a feeble
voice, entered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Propped up with two pillows was a young man
whose wasted features were bright with a hectic
flush; whose arms, hanging loosely from his gown,
were shrunk to the bone and sinews. The eyes were
grey, steady, and assured; so much so that Lanagan
half halted on the threshold as he felt the response
in his own sensitive brain to the personality that
flashed to him through those eyes. A man of mental
power, thought Lanagan; of swift decision and
of iron will.</p>

<p>The voice was little more than a gasp, but each
word by effort was clearly uttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an upper office man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I am a newspaper man. Why did you
ask that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they were here and took my sister for
overdrawing what little funds we had in bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was concentrated fury in his weak voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still I am curious to know how you knew they
were plain-clothes men that took her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? A newspaper man ask how? Because
they walk like a ton of pig lead. And didn&#8217;t that
cursed grocer threaten to have her arrested for a
paltry four or five dollars? I heard her scream
when they took her. This&#8221;&mdash;more quietly, with
a slight shrug and comprehensive gesture to indicate
his wasted form and flushed cheeks&mdash;&#8220;this particular
complaint serves to strengthen our outer faculties
for a while at least, even if it is at the expense
of our inner ones.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>&#8220;I take it your sister is bringing you from the
interior to the South?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. We came from South Dakota. We were
robbed of our tickets on our first night here. She
has been trying to get something to do to save
enough money to get as far as Los Angeles. It
came on me suddenly, alcohol helping. Sis stuck
when they turned me out. On general principles,
I don&#8217;t blame father. I gambled a mortgage on to
the old ranch and twenty years on to his head.
Anyhow, here we are, Sis and me. That&#8217;s what you
fellows on the papers call a human-interest story,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something about the measured and sinister
tone that told of the bitterness of a baffled
strong man, in the face of a situation that he was
powerless to avoid. Lanagan wondered what that
man would have done&mdash;or tried to do&mdash;to him if
he were in full possession of his strength. He
judged from those level grey eyes that the session
would not be uninteresting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it might be a human-interest story,&#8221; said
Lanagan, &#8220;and then again&mdash;it might be better than
a human-interest story.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking at the tip of his cigar, flicking
the ashes from it as he said it; but he caught the
swift, suddenly veiled flash that the keen eyes shot
to his face. To all appearances, though, Lanagan
did not see that glance. He had not liked the ready
talk about upper office men; and he would take oath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that in the wasted features, round the ears and the
neck, were the tell-tale traces of that prison pallor
that requires many a long day to wear away.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance,&#8221; Lanagan continued, still flicking
at his cigar tip, &#8220;if you were being kept under cover
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was only a swift, partial intake of breath,
but Lanagan caught it, and then the man spoke so
easily and smoothly that the newspaper man believed
himself deceived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am. That&#8217;s a bet. But just until Sis
can get me away; that&#8217;s also a bet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there followed details, the man on the pillows
supplying with facility a pedigree that went
back to the <i>Mayflower</i>. Lanagan had been fishing;
yet as he left the room he was uneasy and far from
being satisfied. As the story stood it was a neat little
&#8220;human-interest&#8221; story&mdash;as Harry Turner had
said&mdash;and worth a column and a half. He had
comforted Turner to the extent of informing him
that the shysters had his sister&#8217;s case and would
probably have her out before night. He drifted
moodily back to police headquarters. There Lathrop
met him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing stirring,&#8221; he said, disgustedly.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve turned her loose. Grocer wouldn&#8217;t prosecute.
She&#8217;s got a sick brother. Don&#8217;t think she
was a live one, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan ground one palm into the other. Three-quarters
of the story was gone with the woman free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and his &#8220;hunch&#8221; was afloat without an anchor.
He drifted into Chief Leslie&#8217;s office and helped himself
to a cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief, what did you have on that Turner girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie was past being surprised at anything Lanagan
knew. He stopped studying a police circular
long enough to look up. &#8220;Couple of little checks,
but the complaining witness withdrew. I wouldn&#8217;t
write her up if I were you. She&#8217;s one case entitled
to sympathy. I talked to her. Thoroughbred, that
girl; consumptive brother; taking him South. So
I turned her loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie fell to studying his circular again and Lanagan
drew up a chair to look over the circular also,
a little privilege he alone enjoyed of the newspaper
men at headquarters. Then he whistled softly;
Lanagan was past being surprised at anything&mdash;almost.
That whistle was about his most demonstrative
exhibition.</p>

<p>The circular was from Denver and offered $5,000
reward for information leading to the &#8220;arrest and
conviction&#8221; of Harry Short, wanted for highway
robbery and murder. The details of a Denver crime
that a brief time before had shocked the country
were given and the customary police description,
with the front and profile pictures from the rogues&#8217;
gallery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would probably be found with a woman,&#8221; the
circular read, &#8220;posing as his wife or sister.&#8221; There
followed a description of the woman, Cecile Andrews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and her history. She was the daughter of a
country minister who became enamored of Short
when he did odd jobs about her father&#8217;s place. She
had refused to give him up when he was charged
with triple murder. In some way, it was believed,
she had managed to join him in hiding, for she had
disappeared as completely as he.</p>

<p>Leslie finally became annoyed at Flanagan&#8217;s prolonged
whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Jack,&#8221; he said irascibly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
trying to get these descriptions in my head. Take
that whistle outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; but say, chief&mdash;&#8221; The tone was
tense, drawn taut like a fiddle string. Leslie
wheeled. Lanagan&#8217;s eyes were lighting up with that
curious brightness that flamed there when the
strange brain of the man was at work, when there
was action promised, when the tortuous mazes of
some enigma were unfolding to that inner sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, chief,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I wonder if I could
make a trip, say to Paris, on about one-half of that
reward? I&#8217;ve always had a curiosity to study that
Paris police system. I don&#8217;t approve of newspaper
men taking blood money. It isn&#8217;t in our game.
But it might be proper to take about one-half of that
money in a case like this for a trip like that. What
do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie&#8217;s eyes were searching Lanagan&#8217;s. He
knew of old that Lanagan was not a quibbler and
that he never wasted words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got something, Jack. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Him,&#8221; said Lanagan inelegantly, tapping the
face upon the circular.</p>

<p>Leslie jumped straight up out of his chair. The
police reporter lit a fresh cigar from Leslie&#8217;s top
desk drawer, where the good ones were.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way, chief; but the story&#8217;s mine, mine
absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve brought me the tip, the story&#8217;s yours.
That&#8217;s the way I play the game,&#8221; said Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;This woman was the girl you arrested. Her
brother&#8217;s out in a rooming house on O&#8217;Farrell
Street, laid up with consumption&mdash;galloping, too,
it appears to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie was an explosive man, and after a swift
glance through the circular description of the
woman again, he expressed himself volubly and
with unction. It never occurred to him to question
the accuracy of Lanagan&#8217;s statements. He would
have taken the newspaper man&#8217;s word over that of
one of his own men.</p>

<p>Lanagan telephoned to Sampson, city editor of
the <i>Enquirer</i>, and before that cold-blooded individual
could get in a word, Lanagan had said enough to
indicate to Sampson that something choice was on
the irons. Lanagan had asked for me, and I was
detailed to report to him in thirty minutes at Van
Ness Avenue and Eddy.</p>

<p>It was just thirty minutes later that the chief,
Lanagan, Brady, Wilson, and Maloney&mdash;three of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Leslie&#8217;s steadiest thief takers&mdash;and myself were
dropping singly into 1153A O&#8217;Farrell Street, Lanagan
having preceded us to reassure the landlady.
Maloney went on through to take the alleyway, the
room having a window over the alley. Softly and
swiftly we massed before the door. Lanagan
took the door, rapping. There was no answer.
The chief signaled for a rush.</p>

<p>Leslie never carried but one gun, and this he
now rested in the hollow of his left arm. He towered
above and behind us as we noiselessly wedged
against the old-fashioned, flimsy door. My heart
was beating like a trip hammer. I never seem
to be able to get over that thumping just before
the opening engagement when I am elected to
make a target of myself. I confess freely that I
always went into those thrillers with Lanagan in
the full expectation of getting my own name and
picture in the papers, and the complimentary designation
usually accorded a man of my profession by
the paper he serves when mishap befalls him: &#8220;A
reporter who was killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief breathed a soft command, the wedge
crashed, the bolts burst, and we were in&mdash;an empty
room.</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause, it seemed to me
for an hour; it may have been but a minute, while
Leslie slipped back into his holster that ugly gun
of his. Lanagan was turning slowly, examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
every corner of the room. His eyes were living,
snapping fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess, chief,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;I won&#8217;t make the
reservations to-day for that little trip of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bed was unmade, but the room showed no
traces of recent occupation save several empty
medicine bottles from which the labels had been
washed, and on a closet shelf a paper sack half full
of almonds. There were almond shells on the floor.
For the rest the room held but the ordinary appurtenances
of a room of its kind; washstand, bowl,
towels and rack, and cheap dresser.</p>

<p>The landlady was summoned. She was more
surprised than Lanagan or the chief. She had not
seen the girl return; had not seen the pair depart;
had believed that the man was too sick to leave his
bed.</p>

<p>Galvanic Leslie, within an hour, had men at the
ferry building, at the Third and Townsend Street
Depot, covering every boathouse that had launches
or tugs for hire; the suburban electric lines were
covered and the country roads leading south. The
great mantrap that so easily can be thrown around
the peninsula of San Francisco, the trap that time
and again has caught the thieves of the world when
they have fled for haven to the Western Coast
metropolis, was set. And yet so quietly was the
work done, so implicitly had Leslie impressed upon
every district captain, every detective, every patrolman
concerned with the story, the necessity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
absolute secrecy that not one of the other great
papers of San Francisco knew that the jaws of that
trap were gaping hungrily. Probably there was no
reporter save Lanagan who could have broken into
that story once Leslie had commanded his men to
secrecy. They knew what disloyalty to that disciplinarian
meant too well to trifle with him.</p>

<p>Within the city proper, plain-clothes men by
shoals flooded every hotel and lodging house that
might by any possibility harbour the pair. The hospitals
were watched; half a dozen doctors known
to Leslie worked among their professional brothers,
but no one was attending such a man as Turner.</p>

<p>And the wonder grew to Lanagan that the story,
scattered now well over the city, was even yet escaping
the innumerable sources of news of the <i>Times</i>
and the braggart <i>Herald</i>, to say nothing of the evening
papers, the <i>Record</i> and the <i>Tribune</i>. In such
fashion, though, by grace of newspaper luck, are
the greatest successes scored after they have knocked
around under the very feet of half the newspaper
men of a city.</p>

<p>Of that army of plain-clothes men none worked
harder than Lanagan. For days I did not see him.
Sometimes I would locate him in the foulest sinks
of the Barbary Coast or Chinatown. Here, with
products brewed in some witch&#8217;s caldron, he would
be in fraternity, trying ceaselessly to tap that underground
wire by which the convict bayed in a great
city sends word to his kind. But always he failed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
&#8220;Kid&#8221; Monahan laboured in vain; &#8220;Red&#8221;
Murphy, credited with knowing more thieves than
all the coast saloon men put together, could secure
no trace; Turner, or Short, had found no refuge in
the hutches of the drug or the opium fiends.
Lanagan met men who should have been in San
Quentin; one night he crossed &#8220;Slivers&#8221; Martin,
who had broken from a deputy sheriff and escaped
a ten-year sentence.</p>

<p>Slivers was waiting until he could get out of the
city. Yet even Slivers knew nothing of such a one
as Turner. Finally Lanagan turned his attention to
the residence sections.</p>

<p>At times he would drag me with him. For hours
he would ramble up one street and down another,
always trying the fruit stands, the grocery stores,
the delicatessen stores, and always he asked one
question: Did a blond young woman, with dark blue
eyes, blue tailored suit, quick, nervous walk, come
in and buy nuts, particularly almonds? A dozen
times the answer was yes. And when the customer
was not known to the proprietor, Lanagan would
take up his watch, tireless, indefatigable, and wait
until that person appeared or passed on the street.
Always he met with failure.</p>

<p>Lanagan, always gaunt, became cadaverous.
For four days I lost him. I worried and spent my
nights trying to locate him, but his old haunts
knew him not. One day there came a call for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Norrie?&#8221; It was Lanagan&#8217;s voice; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
sounded thin and tired. &#8220;I&#8217;ve landed. Come to
Eddy and Van Ness. Got your gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>A quick shiver went over me. The climax had
come. I borrowed Sampson&#8217;s gun, having left
mine home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard from Lanagan, have you?&#8221; asked that
austere individual. I nodded. &#8220;Has he landed?
Yes? Good luck,&#8221; said Sampson, his eyes sparkling.
He knew that Lanagan&#8217;s pride, after the first
fiasco, prevented his ringing up until the story was
clinched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give Lanagan my regards. Let us hear from
you. It is not necessary to tell either you or Lanagan
to do your best for speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sampson, reckoned the coldest-blooded city
editor in the West, was yet the most responsive to
a story. He was a driver, but he knew how to
humour men. I disliked him personally, and would
avoid him out of the office, but in harness would
have worked both legs to the ankle for him. Most
of the men on his staff had that fanatical loyalty
for him as a city editor; yet outside they seldom
spoke of him save to damn. Curious breed, reporters.</p>

<p>To his credit as a city editor, in all of those two
weeks he had not complained. He spoke about
Lanagan to me only twice. He knew I was worried,
and knew, I think, that I had spent many a
night searching for him, finally to appear for work
without sleep. But he knew that Lanagan was out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
for the paper first, last, and all the time; knew that
that bloodhound quality of sticking to the trail
would never let him quit till he had proved that
there was no way of landing the story.</p>

<p>Lanagan&#8217;s appearance shocked me. He had not
shaved for a week. Rings were under his eyes, red-lidded
for want of sleep. His pale cheeks held an
unhealthy flush and he coughed once or twice in a
fashion I did not like, but that old magnetic smile
was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scared as a rabbit, I&#8217;ll bet, and wishing you&#8217;d
insured your life first,&#8221; he laughed, pulling me into
a doorway. Then, more seriously, &#8220;Norrie, I&#8217;m
just a wandering hulk, a derelict; whatever you will.
My passing would be nothing to a soul on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had never heard Lanagan speak in that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;No soul on earth,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>Then he swept me with those luminous eyes of
his, and they were as clear and as unclouded as my
own. I knew that I had caught a swift glimpse
as the shutter opened upon the vista of his past;
that secret past that now I understood.</p>

<p>For a moment I was conscious of nothing save
that this man whom I loved like a brother was in
pain and I could do nothing for him. With his
swift perceptions, Lanagan had caught my mood
and our hands met; that lean, sinewy hand was as
firm as steel. Then, with his facile art, he had
thrown aside his humour of introspection and spoke
briskly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>&#8220;Norrie, I don&#8217;t want to tangle you with this
against your will. This man, I believe, is the hardest
game this city has held in my time or yours.
He will die with his stockings on. It looks like
gun play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frankly, I was for quitting, inwardly. Outwardly,
because of that mesmeric way of his, that
teasing, superior tone, I was all for the climax.
Besides, I did not want to leave him to himself in
that humour to go into a mess; I knew his reckless
ways too well.</p>

<p>We walked rapidly up Eddy Street and turned
on Franklin until near the corner of O&#8217;Farrell,
where, entering a flat, Lanagan led the way to the
top story. Here we entered an unfinished alcove
room in the rear with a dormer window covered
by a heavy curtain of burlap. The slightest possible
rent had been made in the curtain. Lanagan
told me to look. Opposite was a dormer window
corresponding to our own, the next house being
one of similar design. The alley between was possibly
ten feet. Our window was the only one that
could command the other.</p>

<p>In the opposite house the curtain was of ordinary
heavy lace. After peering intently for a time,
I could distinguish through it a woman&#8217;s figure and
a bed, upon which a form could be discerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, Norrie. That man shows his
caliber by moving round the corner from his former
home while the police look for him elsewhere. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
knows by now the police descriptions are here; that
I must have recognised him, and that the hunt is
on. My almond trail landed when I came back to
this territory just on the final chance that the man
was big enough to figure out that his surest safety
lay right here. She has been out but a few times,
buying those eternal almonds. Malted milk has
been added to his diet, too. I picked her up, trailed
her, and the rest was easy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s stomach is gone. Incidentally, they
owe a week&#8217;s rent there, and she is living mostly on
almonds now, too; so I guess the exchequer is pretty
low. I didn&#8217;t suppose there were any more women
left in the world like that. This girl, born of good
family, daughter of a minister, takes up with that
triple-stained murderer and sticks. She surely took
that honour and obey in epic earnest&mdash;if she married
him; if not, why, the more credit to her for
sticking.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t for us to judge, Norrie. Keep your
eye glued to that hole while I go into the next room&mdash;I&#8217;ve
rented this attic, by the way&mdash;and grind
out copy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was four o&#8217;clock then; at nine Lanagan ceased
writing. He had made in longhand 6,000 words of
as clean-cut, brilliant a narrative story of its kind
as, under similar pressure, has ever appeared in
print. As in all of Lanagan&#8217;s stories, it was &#8220;the
police&#8221; who had learned this and that. Lanagan
has made several detective sergeants in his time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&#8220;Leslie will meet us here at one o&#8217;clock. We
must keep the smash until two, fire the story at
Sampson by telephone to lead off my stuff with;
hold them in the room until three, and we beat the
town again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hurried out to return in half an hour. He
had telephoned to Sampson that the story would
break about two o&#8217;clock and to hold the paper until
he had heard from us; then he had sent his copy
down by messenger boy and loaded up on a bundle
of the choicest of the rank brand of Manilas he
chose at times to affect. I noticed as he lit a match
that his hands shook. I wanted him to lie down
until one, but his only answer was to fix me with
those eyes of his, glowing like a cat&#8217;s in the darkness
(we were smoking with the lighted ends of our
cigars held inside our hats, so careful was Lanagan
lest any trace be given to the opposite room), and
he laughed that curious laugh of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;When this is over, Norrie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll sleep
for a week. Half that $5,000 is mine; you and
Leslie and the others can divide the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Really, I saw Lanagan in my mind&#8217;s eye already
snooping and prying around those Paris byways; it
sounded too assured as he said it. I wondered
whether I cared for blood money; figured that I
would accept it, and began pleasantly in the gloom
to spend my &#8220;bit&#8221; with much contentment. I concluded
I would accompany Lanagan on that Paris
trip.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>One o&#8217;clock came, and with it Leslie, Brady, Wilson,
and Maloney. Brady was put at the aperture.
A faint light in the opposite room brought the two
figures out into bold relief. The rest of us moved
to the outer room, where the plain-clothes men
slipped their revolvers to their side coat pockets. I
wished lonesomely that I had brought two and that
I might feel braver, although I had as much chance
of shooting a revolver with my left hand without
disaster as of sailing an aeroplane with either. At
that I believe I would have felt more in the picture
with two.</p>

<p>The plan was to pull a fire alarm, and as soon
as the engines clattered into the street, scatter to the
top story, rap on the door as if to warn the occupants,
take them off their guard when the door was
opened, and the thing was done. That programme
was carried out. When the apparatus swung up
from O&#8217;Farrell, filling the still night air with those
strident bells of terror and alarm, we sped to the
top floor and made the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Fire! Fire!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Brady&#8217;s hoarse voice; and even I thrilled,
it was done so realistically. I, as the one most
likely unknown to the pair, had been selected to take
their door. I rapped loudly and shouted the alarm.
Brady was on one side of me, Lanagan on the other.
Wilson, Maloney, and the chief on either side again
in the dark hall, flattened to the wall, guns drawn
ready for the rush. The door opened six inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
a startled, wan face with lustrous blue eyes, shining
vividly above deep circles of black, looked into
mine through the aperture. Possibly something in
my face, possibly native suspicion and fear, induced
her to essay to slam the door. I pushed my
shoulder to the door and shoved, Brady at one
shoulder, Lanagan at the other. She gave back
with one more wide-eyed look that went over my
shoulder and caught the grey-bearded chief, known
to her, huddled back for fear of that very thing.</p>

<p>There came one shrill scream: &#8220;Harry! The
police!&#8221; and she had turned and fled and we pushed
in vain&mdash;the door was chained! One united crash
again, the fastenings gave just as the slight figure,
quicker than a swallow, had darted within the inner
room and slammed the door shut in our faces. A
bolt shot to place as a bullet from within tore
through the panelling and clipped the rim of Brady&#8217;s
hat, and that towering figure bore back out of range
and swung us in a mass with him. Two more shots
tore through and sprayed us with splinters. We
flattened against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;The jig is up, Short; you may as well come
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Leslie, calm as if he were delivering orders
to his chauffeur. A shot rewarded him, impinging
perilously close to his shoulder. The man within
was dying with the convict&#8217;s last desperate ambition
to take a policeman with him. We dropped flat.
There was a pause, while Brady and Leslie counselled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in whispers whether to risk a rush. The
silence became acute, punctuated now and then by
whisperings from the inner room.</p>

<p>It sounded as if she were pleading with him; his
note of finality could not be mistaken, although the
words were not heard. Another silence, and then
to our straining ears, rising clearly above the din
and clamour of doors below stairs opening and shutting,
of shoutings and excited cries, came a trembling
voice floating through the jagged holes of the
inner door&mdash;trembling with the strength or the
ardour of a determination rather than any dread or
fear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Harry, take me, too! Take me, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>No, Cecile, no!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence again from within; and again
that voice, now touched with pleading still more
earnest:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only right, Harry dear; all that the world
held I sacrificed for you. If you don&#8217;t take me, I
will follow you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Prolonged to acuteness became the silence again;
the man&#8217;s voice, hoarse, gasping, finally came:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, Cecile.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again that voice, trembling, yet clear as the
beautiful sweeping chords of a harp, came floating
with the acrid revolver smoke through the jagged,
ugly rents in the panelling, and seemed to flood the
room with something almost like a visible radiance:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Our Father, who art in heaven!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>I saw Maloney, his blue-nosed revolver in hand,
half risen, make the sign of the adoration, touching
his forehead and his chest with that grim muzzle.
Leslie stood slowly upright, his massive head sunk
into his breast. Lanagan breathed hard and deep.
It was awesome; we were held in the spell of that
strange and extraordinary occurrence. On that
beautiful voice went to the end:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us
from evil. Amen.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Amen!</i>&#8221; echoed the murderer&#8217;s choking voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The door! To save her!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Leslie&#8217;s electric whisper, and at his signal
we crashed with our united strength. With the
crashing came two shots, and I caught Lanagan&#8217;s
harsh curse at my ear and his swift mutter: &#8220;Too
late!&#8221; The door gave.</p>

<p>She knelt with her head fallen upon her clasped
hands, just as she had knelt in that final prayer, beside
the bed. He was lying back upon the pillow.</p>

<p>There was no dry eye there. Veteran thief-takers,
men who had stood with their backs to the
wall and death baying them a score of times; men
who would risk the billy or knife or gun as blithely
as they would go to their morning meal; to whom
suffering and violence and death were daily allotments,
bowed themselves before the melancholy end
of that misguided girl.</p>

<p>Yet possibly, for her, it was better so.</p>

<p>It was Lanagan&#8217;s voice that brought me back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Lanagan, answering the newspaper call, with the
dominant newspaper demand still strong upon him
and over him; Lanagan, quick with instinctive
thought for the high-strung, chafing Sampson down
at the <i>Enquirer</i> office and the press waiting for
the release gong; Lanagan, the genius of his craft,
asserting once again his incomparable newspaper
superiority to me, still dreaming the precious seconds
away at the pathetic fate of that poor piece of
clay kneeling there; Lanagan, crisply as a colonel in
the field, snapped:</p>

THE PATHS OF JUDGMENT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">JACK LANAGAN had a Sunday off, the first in
weeks. A man of whim and caprice in his
leisure moments, he had made no plans. This Sunday
morning, after idly reading the morning papers,
rolling and consuming innumerable brown paper
cigarettes meanwhile, he finally sallied forth in his
ill-fitting clothes toward the Palace grill and breakfast.
And this being luxuriously ended, he was
laved and shaved to his heart&#8217;s content. Then, perfumed
like a boulevardier, he issued forth into Market
Street to join that morning throng drifting down
toward the ferry building for the institutional Sunday
outing across the bay. He permitted himself
to drift with the current, perfectly and vastly at
ease with all the world. He had switched from
cigarettes to an evil Manila, poisoning the air cheerfully
for yards around him. Lanagan rather enjoyed
the exclusiveness given him by his noisome
cigars.</p>

<p>Rourke, Fleming, and little Johnny O&#8217;Grady of
the <i>Herald</i>, with a camera man, whirled out of Market
Street in an automobile, and Lanagan jerked
alertly round to watch them out of sight, speculating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
as to what the story might be. He had half
determined to drift over to the office, when Truck
One swung into Market Street from O&#8217;Farrell.
Other fire apparatus was swinging into and out of
Market Street, clanging stridently, and Lanagan
turned again to the ferry. Fires interested him but
little. Always the chance, he remarked once to me
fastidiously, of some chump of a fireman squirting
water all over you, which spoiled your clothes. I
never knew whether Lanagan was having a quiet
joke in that or not. His entire wardrobe would
have been scorned by a rag picker.</p>

<p>He had been puffing his oakum industriously, and
now was attracted by the spectacle of a man beside
him nearly doubled over with a fit of coughing. He
was shaking and beating at his breast with large,
bony hands, and Lanagan noted professionally the
rheumatic knuckles and the nails like claws, yellow
and dirty. His breath came in sharp whistles,
short and staccato, and he was taking possibly a
third of a normal respiration at a time.</p>

<p>A particularly violent paroxysm, followed by all
evidences of entire suspension of breath, brought
Lanagan to the man&#8217;s side with a leap. He swung
the huddled form against a hydrant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you!&#8221; he called, to a passer-by, &#8220;call
Douglas 20 and tell them to shoot the harbour ambulance
up here.&#8221; To himself he said: &#8220;This man
is sick. He needs attention and needs it quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at the words the hunched, choking figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
straightened spasmodically, flashing a look upon
Lanagan that Lanagan, used to malevolence in all
its forms expressed upon features the most evil, had
not seen quite equalled. Accustomed to the ill-featured
and repulsive as they strain through the bars
at the city prison, yet even Lanagan started back
momentarily in revulsion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen misers,&#8221; thought Lanagan, &#8220;but
this is the real miser of all fact and all fiction. I
would know him in a million. Fellow I used to see
in my dreams when I was a youngster. Pneumonia
sure. About six hours for him and then six feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus lightly diagnosing and disposing of the man
and his case, Lanagan motioned the citizen, who
had meantime stopped, to go on with the call. But
the strange, gnomelike figure, flashing another look,
a singular blend of loathing, hate, fear, and timidity,
upon the newspaper man, started to hobble away.
Lanagan dropped his hand on the man&#8217;s shoulder to
restrain him. But the harsh features turned a look
so glowering and repellent upon him that he withdrew
the restraining hand. The coughing had
ceased. The little old man was still breathing
sibilantly and swiftly, rather like a panting dog or
cat, which he suggested, but by extraordinary effort
of will had fought away the more violent exhibition
of his seizure. He commenced to shuffle down the
street, with one furtive, fearful, backward look that
went on past Lanagan and up Market Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need a hospital, man,&#8221; said Lanagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
curtly, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going to take you there. Wait.&#8221;
He placed his hand again on the man&#8217;s shoulder.
But the manikin-like creature flung the hand viciously
from him and again flashed that strange look
of blended hate, fear, and timidity upon the newspaper
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let be!&#8221; he grated. &#8220;Let be!&#8221;</p>

<p>A car clanged to the safety station. The grotesque
figure, still half-hunched over at the paroxysm
from Lanagan&#8217;s Manila, started for it and Lanagan
made no further effort at detention. He climbed
laboriously to the platform, and Lanagan shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly am not going to dry-nurse you, old
man, but I ought to at that. If I ever saw a man
marked for death, you&#8217;re that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite a long afternoon idled away beneath
mine host Pastori&#8217;s shade trees and the somnolent
influence of cobwebbed Chianti, Lanagan found his
miser&#8217;s features constantly before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my miser, too,&#8221; he mused, in the vernacular
of childhood. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have let him escape
me after finding him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Returning late, Lanagan for once in his life went
to his room without his inevitable last call at police
headquarters. Consequently he was several hours
late in the morning on the news of a very fine police
story when he awakened to find his miser&mdash;Thaddeus
Miller of Oakland&mdash;pictured on the front
pages of all the morning papers. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
mistaking that face. It was his miser. He had
been murdered in his cabin, a clumsy attempt having
been made to fire the cabin to destroy the crime and
its evidence.</p>

<p>A young clerk, a neighbour to the miser, was under
arrest. It appeared that the clerk, James Watson,
was found named in the will as sole legatee to
an estate valued at close to a quarter of a million
dollars. Upon the Watson porch had been found
a hammer, freshly washed, the handle not yet dry.
But clinging to the claws, unobserved by whoever
had washed the blood from the hammer, were two
strands of white hair that brought the hammer
home to the crime in the cabin. Watson, the stories
related, had only known Miller for a few months.
He had been seen leaving the cottage shortly before
eight o&#8217;clock. The fire was discovered
smouldering at nine-thirty o&#8217;clock, extinguished, and
Miller found with his skull crushed, lying on a
kerosene-soaked bunk, to which, fortunately, the
clumsily started fire had not yet communicated.</p>

<p>Watson had made a bad case out for himself initially
by denying that he had seen Miller at all that
day or knowing that he was named in the will.
When confronted by neighbours who had seen him
leaving the cottage and one neighbour who had
heard his wife speak of the will, he took refuge in
protestations that he had denied everything through
fear and terror. He then admitted owning the
hammer, but professed himself at a loss to account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
for the fact of its having been freshly washed and
of the strands of gray hair.</p>

<p>Raving his innocence, he had come to the verge
of physical collapse. He repeated constantly the
name of his wife and begged the police to bring her
to him. But he was being held in strict &#8220;detinue,&#8221;
the papers said, until the third degree was given him.
At the time of going to press confession was expected
momentarily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson, after a police examination, had
been permitted to return to her home. Her story
was that both she and her husband had befriended
Miller on different occasions, out of pity for his
forlorn and miserable condition. She admitted
that on one occasion he had jocularly remarked that
he would not forget her husband in his will, but had
attached no importance to his remark. She had
never heard him speak of any person that he feared.
She admitted that her husband had visited Watson
at his cabin in the evening, but that the circumstance
was not unusual. He had remained but a moment,
Miller being in an unusually morose mood&mdash;had
been so, in fact, for three or four days. She was
at a loss to account for the condition of the hammer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; growled Lanagan, &#8220;I&#8217;m eternally
doomed if I think either of them did it. That fellow
gave me a look that spelled fear; abject, abnormal
fear; it was the concentration of the fear of a
lifetime of a hare who runs with the dogs always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
at his heels. And it was not fear of the Watsons
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan, stopping at the office only long enough
to receive instructions, made the narrow-gauge
ferry by bowling over an obstreperous ticket-taker
who tried to shut the gate in his face. Not that
there was any particular need for such spectacular
haste; it was merely Lanagan&#8217;s way; Lanagan
&#8220;showing off,&#8221; as some of his professional brothers
would invidiously have it. But I, who knew him
better than any news writer in the business, say not.
Lanagan was a genuine eccentric. And in this particular
case he was fighting for time. Bitter experience
had taught him the value of minutes. Indeed,
a cardinal rule of his business that Lanagan
sought to drive into my slower newspaper intelligence
was to get on the ground first.</p>

<p>Lanagan knew of old that every city editor in
town would be accepting the very plausible police
version, and would be awaiting the expected confession
from Watson. Watson might confess, but,
Lanagan had a sullen &#8220;hunch&#8221; that he wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Lanagan moved most of the time by &#8220;hunches,&#8221;
as many successful newspaper men&mdash;to say nothing
of detectives&mdash;do. Hunches and luck may
be called by such fancy brands as inductive or deductive,
intensive or extensive analytical capacity;
but in the long run most crimes are solved on luck,
hunches, and through the invaluable aid of police
&#8220;stool pigeons,&#8221; more politely known as &#8220;sources.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
An intuitive judgment of men is about as good an
asset as a reporter or detective can have, coupled
with a faculty for quick decision and personal
bravery.</p>

<p>More than any one thing, it was possibly this
faculty for swift intuitive analysis that carried
Lanagan to his high degree of success. However,
man and man&#8217;s judgments are fallible; it was so
ordered in the original scheme of things, for very
obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Lanagan went directly to the Watson cottage.
The brilliant American police system had permitted
some scores of curious and morbid persons to
trample over every inch of ground within a hundred
yards of the Miller hut. Privileged friends
of the patrolman on guard there, after the traditional
American custom also, had been permitted
to slip inside and paw over the belongings and stare
to their hearts&#8217; content. Lanagan knew of old
what the situation there would be. That could
wait. He was more concerned with having the first
meeting of the day with Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>It was a modest little &#8220;bungalow style&#8221; of home
that he approached, much like that of any one of
thousands of small-salaried men in the transbay
suburban sections. An air of good taste, neatness,
and care in the trim little lawn, the cleanliness of
the walks, stairs and porch, and the precision with
which all of the shades were drawn against the
morning sun, marked it possibly a bit more individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
than many of its kind. Mrs. Watson herself
opened the door to his ring. She bore the outward
evidence of grief. Her eyes were red and
swollen, her cheeks hectic, her hair disheveled. She
was blond, with large blue eyes, set possibly a line
too closely together, chiseled nose, delicate, shapely
ears, saving the lobe was not quite as free as an
exact taste would require, and a well-moulded chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Lanagan of the <i>Enquirer</i>,&#8221; he said,
adding some words of apology. He had a way with
women&mdash;and with men as well&mdash;when he so desired,
that was singularly ingratiating; a soft trick
of speech, an ingenuousness of manner, a certain
dignity that seemed to lift him from the mean atmosphere
of his ill-fitting clothes and marked him
with personality.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may come in,&#8221; said Mrs. Watson.</p>

<p>As he followed her to the parlour and she lifted
the shades, he noticed that she was of good figure,
rather lithe in her movements, laced well in for a
housewife unappareled for the street, not more than
three-and-twenty, and that she walked with that
scarcely perceptible lift of the shoulders and swing
of the hips that denotes a woman not entirely unconscious,
even in the stress of melancholy circumstances,
of the gaze of a man; a suggestion of affectation,
the unmistakable mark of a woman inclined
by temperament to be naturally frivolous; or even,
upon occasion, reckless. He noticed, too, that she
wore French heels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>&#8220;Curious type certainly,&#8221; commented Lanagan
mentally. &#8220;Sort of a domesticated coryphée; with
the homing instinct implanted where the wanderlust
was planted in her sisters. One who has settled
into marriage where her like settle, with as little
concern, into the round circle of the night lights.
Everything different except that generic vanity.
Rather an odd mating for a clerk, and a plodder
at that, to judge from his picture,&#8221; thought Lanagan.</p>

<p>Lanagan sat with his back to the window, putting
Mrs. Watson in the full light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything you can say, Mrs. Watson,
that could throw any light upon this affair? Any
enemies that Miller ever spoke about? Any visitors
that he has had of late? Any letters or other messages
that he received? Any threats?&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw both hands forth with a despairing
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, nothing!&#8221; she moaned, as tears came.
&#8220;It is terrible, terrible! He is innocent, innocent
I say! I know he is innocent! I know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sobbed for a moment, and then, with a sudden
gesture of determination, straightened up, dried
her eyes, and composed herself.</p>

<p>Lanagan had been watching her with eyes that
seemed to narrow and lessen to little black beads.
His ears, gifted with abnormal power for receiving
and disintegrating into each component shade of
meaning or emotion the tones of the human voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
drank in every word that she uttered, marked each
sob that shook her form.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not believe your husband guilty, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips parted in an exclamation of protest, and
Lanagan for the first time caught the upper lip;
a lip as thin as a paper cutter, that drew tautly and
white across the perfect teeth. It suggested a knife
to Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;She holds true to the type,&#8221; he commented to
himself grimly. &#8220;A curious type, surely, for a
prosaic clerk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan&#8217;s brain was churning. His beady eyes
gleamed as though touched with phosphorescence.
Under the concentration of his gaze, the woman unconsciously
shrank. Rising from his chair with a
movement almost tigerish, he strode before her, upturned
her face so that her eyes looked straight up
into his, and then, his voice terrific in its tension,
and yet scarcely louder than a whisper, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did <i>you</i> wheedle Thaddeus Miller into making
a will in your favour and then murder him?&#8221;</p>

<p>So quickly that her act seemed rather involuntary
than by any conscious impulse, she leaped to her feet,
her breast rising and falling tumultuously. She
struggled inarticulately for speech, raised her hand
as though to strike him in the face, and collapsed in
a swoon at his feet.</p>

<p>Lanagan gazed coldly down upon her without
qualm. He was impersonal now; the incarnation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of newspaper truth. He only regretted that she
had balked him by swooning. Swiftly he straightened
her out, loosed her collar, and was busily engaged
chafing her hands when heavy footfalls
sounded from the porch, and the bell rang loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the brogans and the ring, our friends of the
upper office,&#8221; commented Lanagan cynically as he
opened the door. Quinlan and Pryor from the
Oakland department entered, viewing Lanagan suspiciously
as they beheld the still form upon the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in better shape for the hospital than your
third degree in the detinue cells,&#8221; remarked Lanagan,
vouchsafing no explanations. &#8220;Went out just
this minute as I was interviewing her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quinlan and Pryor settled themselves heavily, lit
fresh cigars, made laboured notes of the circumstances,
and, when Lanagan finally restored the woman,
gave her some breathing space and then informed
her that she was to be taken to see her husband.
To Lanagan she directed no look&mdash;addressed
no word. She moved as one in a trance.</p>

<p>The detectives and their prisoner departed and
Lanagan turned for the Miller cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a pure soul&#8217;s denial or it was a guilty
soul&#8217;s defiance,&#8221; thought Lanagan. &#8220;But which?&#8221;</p>

<p>Long he turned that over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frankly, on type I mistrust her; but what about
that look in Miller&#8217;s eyes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan seldom went back on a &#8220;hunch.&#8221; At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
first flash he had declared the Watsons innocent.
He was not yet ready to abandon that; and yet the
circumstances were certainly trending toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;there&#8217;s a nigger in this
woodpile somewhere that I haven&#8217;t located.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cottage had nothing to offer. Police, curio
hunters, and shoals of newspaper men had combed
it Lanagan hurried to the Oakland police headquarters
and cocked his feet on Inspector Henley&#8217;s
desk while that astute individual detailed to him
the various steps taken by the police in fixing the
crime on Watson. Lanagan was nettled. It
sounded highly convincing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure of Watson?&#8221; he finally asked,
quizzically, helping himself to a fist-full of Henley&#8217;s
cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clearest case I have ever handled,&#8221; said Henley,
moving the cigar box out of reach. &#8220;Every link
is complete. Further: the woman is in on it and
we&#8217;ll have her within twenty-four hours. We&#8217;ll get
the case before Baxter and they&#8217;ll swing inside of
three months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Lanagan, &#8220;you&#8217;re wrong again,
Henley.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inspector flushed. He had a lively recollection
of how Lanagan had &#8220;trimmed&#8221; him on the
Stockslager murder and he didn&#8217;t take kindly to the
&#8220;again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the motive, the property; and the
means, the hammer. What more do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>&#8220;Well, to complete the alliteration, I suppose you
want the murderer,&#8221; said Lanagan with a faint
laugh. &#8220;And you haven&#8217;t got him. Pretty good
smokes. Just slip back that box. I don&#8217;t get over
your way very often. You act as though you had
paid for those cigars yourself. Can I see Watson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Henley, surlily. He never cared to
argue the little matters such as Lanagan was fond
of nagging him with; some way he had a feeling
that Lanagan always knew just a trifle more than
he told. He passed back the box. &#8220;But it&#8217;s an
even break. Nobody&#8217;s seen him. Here&#8217;s his picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan studied the front and profile of a young
man of twenty-six, a face of surprising frankness
and honesty. Every line held to Lanagan&#8217;s critical
eye the lie to the number striped across his breast;
another feature of our brilliant American police system
that puts the rogue&#8217;s gallery blazon on a man
before he is tried.</p>

<p>As Lanagan passed out, his eye fell on the bulletin
board in the detectives&#8217; room. The last discharge
slip from San Quentin was pasted upon it,
the slip by which all police stations are supposed
to keep in touch with prisoners discharged during
the past month. But through long familiarity few
of the detectives stop to read carefully. More from
habit than anything else, Lanagan read those sheets
as a preacher reads the book&mdash;he scanned it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>The fifth name on the list caught his eye:
Ephraim Miller, alias Thad Miller, alias Thornton
Miles, alias Iowa Slim; assault to murder; twenty-five
years. The slip was dated the first&mdash;five days
back. There was little chance of its being read
now. Swift as a lightning flash Lanagan had
formed his theory. His mind leaped back to the
meeting with Miller in front of the Palace.
Ephraim and Thaddeus; they were old-fashioned
names. Then there was the &#8220;Thad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miller had been from San Quentin but four days:
Miser Miller&#8217;s fear had been on him but a few days.
Possibly this was a wayward son, some unrecognised
offspring, some family skeleton recrudescent;
perhaps it was this convict who had brought that
fear into the eyes of Thaddeus Miller!</p>

<p>It was a long, fine chance; but the most brilliant
of newspaper successes are scored on long, fine
chances. Lanagan determined to take it. He
&#8220;rapped&#8221; to the hunch, as he used to style it; under
the impulse of his new idea he was a human dynamo.</p>

<p>He was back in San Francisco within an hour,
and headed straight for Billy Connors&#8217; Buckets of
Blood, that famed rendezvous within a stone&#8217;s
throw of the Hall of Justice, where the leaders of
the thieves&#8217; clans foregathered. There he waited
an hour until &#8220;Kid&#8221; Monahan, popularly designated
as King of the Pick-pockets, came in. The
Kid was now a fence. He had retired from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
active practice of his profession after doing time
twice. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t there with the touch any more,&#8221;
he remarked sadly to Lanagan one day. He
was, moreover, credited with being the man for
an outsider to &#8220;see&#8221; who wanted to operate locally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kid,&#8221; said Lanagan, &#8220;I want you to find me
Ephraim Miller, alias Thad Mills, alias Thornton
Miles, alias Iowa Slim. Just out of San Quentin
where he did twenty-five years for assault to murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t keep no line on these old ones,&#8221; retorted
the &#8220;King&#8221; professionally. &#8220;But if he&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to report here he reports to me. It&#8217;s pretty
hard on us native sons with that reform bunch on
the Police Commission and the sky pilots stuffing
you guys on the papers full of knocks. There ain&#8217;t
no touch-off work bein&#8217; done around here by any
travellers that we can help. When do you want
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet me here to-night at ten. I must have
him located by then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan had befriended the &#8220;King&#8221; once, and
he held that illustrious gentleman&#8217;s absolute loyalty.
He knew the &#8220;King&#8221; would have a dozen men out
in as many minutes.</p>

<p>Lanagan headed back for Oakland to round up
the loose ends of the story. He found police headquarters
jammed with newspaper men and the smell
of many flash powders heavy on the air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>&#8220;All right, Mr. Lanagan of the <i>Enquirer</i>,&#8221; quoth
Henley. &#8220;You can talk to Watson now.&#8221; His
tone was triumph.</p>

<p>Watson had confessed. He was sitting in a
chair in the Inspector&#8217;s room, a huddled figure of
misery. The mantle of age seemed to have settled
on him overnight.</p>

<p>Lanagan was a hard loser. He stepped over to
the huddled man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me, Watson,&#8221; he said so
low that no one but Watson heard him; &#8220;do you
mean to tell me that you are not lying, putting your
neck in the noose&mdash;to save your wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; the denial was a shriek. &#8220;I killed
him! I killed him for his money, I tell you!&#8221;
He fell back, shivering.</p>

<p>Lanagan drove in on him. &#8220;You lie, I tell you,&#8221;
he hissed. &#8220;You lie! You fool! It&#8217;s bound to
come out! Tell the truth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; moaned Watson. &#8220;I did it alone.
God! I can feel his skull crunching yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got more imagination than I credited
you with,&#8221; sneered Lanagan savagely. &#8220;That last
was a good touch.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a hustle as Quinlan and Pryor came
through the prison gates from the detinue cells surrounded
by an eager coterie of newspaper men.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got her, Inspector!&#8221; cried Quinlan with
unprofessional feeling. &#8220;She&#8217;s &#8216;spilled.&#8217; Killed
him herself, and says her husband is lying if he says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
he did it. They&#8217;re both in it. We will have the
whole thing now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman was then brought out after her
official statement had been taken. Nothing that the
newspaper men could do could shake her story. In
substance she said that she had worked on the old
man for months to have the will made out in her
husband&#8217;s favour. Knowing her husband was
above such a deed, she planned and executed it
alone. She had not had an opportunity to wash
the hammer after she returned home, and only did
so when the furor commenced. That was why it
was still damp and why she had overlooked the two
strands of incriminating gray hair.</p>

<p>The newspaper camera men snapped and exploded
flashes; the inquisitorial circle broke up, and Watson
having been removed, the room was cleared of
all save Henley, Mrs. Watson, and Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Through?&#8221; asked Henley sarcastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; snapped Lanagan. &#8220;You say you killed
this man. I say, Mrs. Watson, you&#8217;re a liar. You
no more killed that man than I did. You are lying
to save your husband!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice had risen; his aspect was fairly ferocious;
his sallow face flushed to an unwholesome
grey-blue; his eyes glowing again with that catlike
phosphorescence that she had seen and quailed at
once before.</p>

<p>But again he was doomed to disappointment at a
breakdown, for again under the shock she collapsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
after half rising to her feet with evident purpose
to give him the lie as violently as he gave it to her.</p>

<p>Women, Lanagan reflected, are like electric wires.
They are drawn to carry just so much voltage. A
little overplus and they burn out. Each time he had
bullied the woman just as her nerves were at the
breaking point.</p>

<p>The matron bustled in with a side compliment on
Lanagan for his brutality, and lifted the limp form.
Lanagan, bitterly chagrined at the events of the day,
turned on his heel to return to San Francisco. On
the ferry he broke a vow of six months and fell
back on absinthe. He reached the office at seven
o&#8217;clock, wrote steadily for two hours a story identical
as he knew it would be with all the morning
papers, and then went out.</p>

<p>The word was passed swiftly that Lanagan was
drinking again, and I was released for the night to
round him up and get him home&mdash;my usual assignment
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>On the chance that some of the choice spirits that
foregather at Connors&#8217; dive might have crossed his
path, I dropped in there, and, to my unbounded relief,
saw Lanagan himself at a table in deep conversation
with &#8220;Kid&#8221; Monahan. I went over to
his table, the &#8220;King&#8221; slipping out the side door.
I had not Lanagan&#8217;s penchant for camaraderie with
that breed, and took little pains not to let him know
it.</p>

<p>The old wild, reckless light shone from Lanagan&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
eyes, and I knew there was no measuring his stride
that night, making pace or keeping it.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud. &#8220;Art there, old truepenny?&#8221;
and slapped my shoulder. He was in high
feather with himself, that was clear. &#8220;Come.
Have you got your gun?&#8221; I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. Now for the grand &#8216;feenale,&#8217; as
Cæsar says about his <i>ponce à la toscana</i>. And success
to all hunches!&#8221; There was something besides
absinthe burning back in those eyes.</p>

<p>Questions were useless, so I trailed along. At
Macnamara&#8217;s corner we picked up Brady and Wilson,
two of Chief Leslie&#8217;s trustiest men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the chief instruct you?&#8221; asked Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said to report to you and keep our heads
shut or tend daisies,&#8221; replied Brady, the senior of
the pair, and a cool and heady thief-taker; also the
champion pistol shot of the department.</p>

<p>&#8220;My man is Iowa Slim, wanted for murder. Is
heavily armed and desperate. He&#8217;s in the Tokio&mdash;Jap
lodging house at Dupont and Clay. It looks
like break the door and rush. Wilson, Norton, and
I will take the door, and you, Brady, stand free of
the rush and be ready to drop him if he shows fight.
That is, Norton will&mdash;&#8221; turning to me in his quizzical,
bantering way, &#8220;&mdash;if he relishes the job!&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t relish the job. But, as usual, when he
spoke to me in that superior, teasing way I blundered
in valiantly where my native caution would
have feared to tread. I am free to admit that I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of that branch of the profession that believes a reporter
full of lead in peace or war is of very little
use on earth, and certainly not elsewhere, to the
paper that employs him.</p>

<p>In the shadows the detectives nonchalantly slipped
their revolvers into their side coat pockets. Neither
was cumbered by an overcoat; double-line your sack
coat, the old-timers will tell you, but keep away from
excess encumbrances where possible. One gallant
officer in my time lost his life because he was two
seconds delayed unbuttoning an overcoat for his
gun.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later we assembled, one by one,
at convenient corners to the Tokio, a foul-smelling,
ramshackle affair. One by one we drifted in,
slipped off our shoes and tiptoed up the stairs, Lanagan
in the lead, Norton bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Lanagan paused before a corner door. He and
Wilson braced against it. My bulk backed Wilson.
Brady towered above us, standing free to have a
clear sweep with both guns. He turned the light
on full, taking every chance of making targets of
us all for the one chance of getting a drop on Slim
without bloodshed.</p>

<p>From an adjacent room a clock ticked loudly;
somebody rolled over in bed, and the sounds came
so clearly that it seemed my heart must have beat
as loudly as a trip hammer. Yet it was not exactly
fear, as I recall it; it was a sort of nervous tension
to have it over with if it had to come.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>&#8220;Slim! Slim!&#8221; It was a soft, sibilant whisper,
and I could scarcely believe my ears. It was Lanagan
at the keyhole. Then he rapped four times in
quick, soft staccato, and then four times more.
It was some code he had learned, possibly from
Monahan.</p>

<p>There was a prolonged pause, and the sound of
someone from within turning in bed, and another
long pause. The strain on me was terrific. From
the corner of my eye I caught the black muzzle of
Brady&#8217;s left-hand gun. It was as steady as though
held in a vise, and I had time to marvel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slim! Slim! They&#8217;re after me! It&#8217;s Larry
Bowman&#8217;s pal, Shorty!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another nerve-racking pause, and then at the very
keyhole came through a soft, throaty whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shorty Davis. Larry said you&#8217;d take me in.
Quick, Slim, they&#8217;re after me!&#8221;</p>

<p>A key grated, the knob turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; hissed Lanagan, and with one mighty
lurch we burst pell-mell into the room. I caught a
flashing look at a slender, flannel-shirted figure with
a week&#8217;s growth of beard as Slim whirled a foot
ahead of us and with one leap cleared the room and
swung with a murderous long-barrelled Colt in his
hand.</p>

<p>His leap was quicker than the spring of a cat.
He shot from the hip, but Brady, posted to do just
the trick he did, spoiled the shot. Slim&#8217;s bullet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
ripped a two-inch hole through the floor as he crumpled
down in a heap.</p>

<p>We stretched him upon the bed. He had got it
in the lungs. Wilson started for the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; said Lanagan, &#8220;the chief&#8217;s orders.
You are not to talk. If it gets out, tell all reporters
it&#8217;s a detinue case. I&#8217;ll answer for the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few gnomelike, corpselike, yellow faces peered
from doors, but a flash from Brady&#8217;s star sent them
scurrying back. The shot was apparently not heard
in the street, for no one came.</p>

<p>Lanagan turned to Slim, who was choking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what you were wanted for, Slim?&#8221;
he asked in as cool a voice as a surgeon might ask
for your pulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Oakland job, I suppose,&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;Well, boys, you did me a good turn croaking me.
I never wanted to go back to that hell hole again.
I did what I came out to do, what I&#8217;ve waited
twenty-five years to do, and I&#8217;m ready to take my
judgment. He sent me up there twenty-five years
ago, and he murdered my father as surely as there
is a God, who will some day dope it all out right
according to a different scheme than they do here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gasping, with many halts, he told his story. The
surgeon came, shook his head, and devoted himself
to keeping life until the story was taken down.</p>

<p>His father, a wealthy Iowan, had come to Thaddeus
Miller&#8217;s ranch thirty years ago, bringing with
him his entire fortune for investment. The son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Ephraim remained at school back home. At Miller&#8217;s
ranch the boy&#8217;s father had been found in the
well one day, drowned. A whiskey bottle floated
on the water beside him. His entire estate had been
willed to Thaddeus Miller. In a sparsely settled
community Thaddeus Miller&#8217;s story had been accepted&mdash;that
the brother, in drink, had stumbled
into the well. The son had journeyed across the
continent to find himself disinherited. He had always
been told he was to be his father&#8217;s heir. His
father in Iowa had been a strict abstainer. So far
as the son knew, he had never touched liquor. But
his charge, that Thaddeus had in some fashion gotten
his father intoxicated, forced him to sign a will,
and then pitched him into the well with the bottle,
while it created some natural excitement, could never
be proved, and in the course of time became forgotten.
In spite of a contest, the will stood.</p>

<p>Ephraim took to drink and fell in with evil companions.
For petty offences he was sentenced and
earned his name of Iowa Slim. One night in
liquor, fired with his wrongs, he determined to ransack
Miller&#8217;s house. He knew the old man kept a
large amount of money concealed there. It was his,
he believed, and he determined to have it. Miller
had caught him. In the scuffle he beat his uncle
and left him for dead, and in the stovepipe he had
found a bag of gold. But as he was leaving the
grounds, neighbours, driving along on the lonely
country road, who had heard the first screams of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
old man, surrounded him. The uncle prosecuted
him with all the wealth and influence at his command,
and the son, at the age of eighteen years, was
sentenced to San Quentin for twenty-five years
for assault to murder.</p>

<p>As sentence was pronounced he had turned on his
uncle and warned him that the day he was freed
from prison he would come back and kill him.
From time to time he had managed to send threats
by discharged convicts, who carried the word with
the unfailing obligation of the convict brotherhood.
He had driven the old man from place to
place.</p>

<p>He had lost track of him for an entire year, and
was planning how best to locate him again when he
unexpectedly met him face to face on the streets of
San Francisco, followed him to his home, waited
until the neighbourhood was quiet, and then had
stolen in, wakened the old man from sleep, and
asked about his father&#8217;s property.</p>

<p>Under the fear of death Miller had made a promise
of restitution, but in an unguarded moment he
said he &#8220;would make a new will.&#8221; Slim demanded
what he meant by a new will, and the uncle had confessed
the will to the Watsons merely to cheat the
nephew in case he had come back and fulfilled his
courtroom threat. The uncle had kept count and
knew to a day when Slim was to be released. Enraged
beyond endurance at that, Slim had seized up
the hammer and crushed the old man&#8217;s head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>&#8220;But as I live,&#8221; he breathed hoarsely, &#8220;the man
was as good as dead before I hit him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lanagan interrupted, &#8220;I know that,
Slim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim looked at Lanagan with dull curiosity, but
was too far gone to ask explanations, and he continued
with his story, telling of sprinkling kerosene
and touching it with a match. He then had gone
to the Watson cottage, carrying the hammer, intending
if the couple were not in to locate and destroy
the will; and if they were to do double murder if
necessary to get it. Miller had said they had it, an
untruth, told evidently in the childish hope that Slim
might leave him and search for it. While still waiting
for an opportunity of entering the house, the
smouldering fire had been discovered at the Miller
cottage, and he had fled, the thought coming to him
to leave the hammer on the Watson porch, not
knowing the hammer belonged to them and had
been borrowed by Miller. The arrest of the
two for murder might pave the way for him to
have his property restored as the next of kin to
Miller.</p>

<p>He signed the confession laboriously, and the
story was done.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, cull,&#8221; he said to Brady, dropping
back to the vernacular. &#8220;You did me a good trick
not sending me back. There ain&#8217;t no hard feelings
on my part.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised himself by a sudden effort, his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
peering far, far away and beyond the sordid scene
of his dissolution.</p>

<p>&#8220;I squared&mdash;all&mdash;accounts&mdash;dad&mdash;I
squ&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped back on the pillow. The surgeon
bent his head to Slim&#8217;s breast, then slowly straightened
up and drew the sheet over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor lad!&#8221; said Lanagan softly. &#8220;They will
judge you differently there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then again the newspaper mind curtly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Brady, you and Wilson stay here until I come
back. Nobody gets in. Nobody, understand?
Doc, we&#8217;ll have to impound you, too, until three.
Understand, Brady?&#8221; Brady nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Norrie,&#8221; snapped Lanagan incisively,
&#8220;beat it, boy, beat it!&#8221;</p>

<p>For two hours Lanagan and I fed paper into our
typewriters, with Sampson himself whisking the
sheets away as they came from the platens. The
M. E. even came in once or twice and tried to preserve
his dignity while he scanned the copy hot from
the typewriter.</p>

<p>The thrill of Lanagan&#8217;s great exclusive was
throughout the entire plant. Not a half-dozen people
in the office knew just what the story was, but
each knew by the subtle instinct of communication
that the big scoop of the year was shooting down
the pneumatic to the composing room.</p>

<p>Not until we had the first papers, sticky and inky
and fragrant, in our eager fingers, did we stir from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
our desks. Then followed the usual jubilation as
the scouts ran in with the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Herald</i>
with the &#8220;Watsons Confess&#8221; scareheads.</p>

<p>Ah, that is life, that exaltation of the &#8220;exclusive&#8221;!</p>

<p>We wandered leisurely down to the Tokio. The
story was wide open now. We were through. The
morgue notified, Brady and Wilson stayed to attend
to the routine, and Lanagan announced that he was
going to Oakland.</p>

<p>We caught the paper boat, riding luxuriously on
heaps of <i>Enquirers</i>. Thus it happened that we were
at police headquarters there with the copies of our
own paper before the route carriers had made their
deliveries. Lanagan stepped to the &#8217;phone and rang
up Henley.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel like buying a drink?&#8221; asked Lanagan.</p>

<p>Over the wire came back some hearty and measured
compliments. &#8220;You&#8217;re sure in an amiable humour.
Well, come down. You&#8217;ve got two prisoners
to free. If conditions at your jail weren&#8217;t so
rotten I wouldn&#8217;t say anything till morning. But I
need a drink, which is on you, and the Watsons need
a breath of fresh air.&#8221; In fifteen minutes Henley
was with us.</p>

<p>He was a gallant officer, that Henley. When
he had finished he wrung Lanagan&#8217;s hand until I
thought he never would let go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring in the Watsons,&#8221; he ordered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>In a moment they came in, a weary, worn, misery-marked
couple. It was their first meeting since
their imprisonment. With a sob, asking no why
or wherefore, Mrs. Watson fell into her husband&#8217;s
arms and mingled her tears with his. Her sobs&mdash;weary,
worn, tired little sobs&mdash;echoed softly under
the vaulted ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am pleased to inform you,&#8221; Henley said
grandly, &#8220;that through the efforts of our brilliant
young friend of the <i>Enquirer</i>, the murderer of Miller
has been located. You are free.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then followed such a scene of hysterical gladness
and tearful, joyous explanations as Henley&#8217;s room,
that had beheld many strange and unusual scenes,
had never witnessed.</p>

<p>Of course Watson, when arrested, confronted
with the hammer and told that his wife had confessed,
had yielded to the third degree and, unable
to accept the full horror of it, yet had swiftly formed
his plan to confess to save the woman he loved, even
though she might have done the deed.</p>

<p>She, on her part, told a similar story, had
formed her plan, for it appeared that when the
furor was raised after the murder was discovered
she had found the hammer on her porch with
fresh blood stains; knew it had been in Miller&#8217;s
cottage, and had washed it hurriedly, not knowing
in her excitement just what to do, her husband even
then having been taken to the scene of the crime by
the police.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>In face of his confession and her own hammer
found stained in such manner, she had actually believed
that he had committed the crime.</p>

<p>The police automobile drove up and the Watsons
were escorted to it.</p>

<p>For the twentieth time, her eyes still tear-filled,
Mrs. Watson said: &#8220;What can we ever do to thank
you, Mr. Lanagan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me certain brutal conduct,&#8221; laughed
that individual. &#8220;As I hope the Lord will forgive
me,&#8221; he added <i>sotto voce</i>, &#8220;for misjudging you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the automobile sped away to return a very
happy couple to their home, Lanagan, hat doffed and
in hand, bowed profoundly after the retreating machine,
and remarked with veneration to the world
at large:</p>

<p>&#8220;The tenth woman, gentlemen, the tenth woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then to Henley: &#8220;Inspector, I believe you said
something about buying?&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;KIND of caught you fellows off base, Norrie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bradley, star man for the <i>Herald</i>, drawled it at
me invidiously as I entered the police reporters&#8217;
room at the Hall of Justice. Merriman of the
<i>Times</i> and a half-dozen morning paper men, their
copy turned in, had drifted down to the room to
await any late developments. The Ratto story had
been on for three days and the <i>Herald</i> and the
<i>Times</i> had &#8220;put over&#8221; the arrest of Bernardo Tosci,
Camorrist, at the expense of Lanagan and myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better shoot a few absinthe drips into Lanagan,&#8221;
continued Bradley, &#8220;and then maybe you&#8217;ll land
something. He&#8217;s been sober so long he&#8217;s lost his
grip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bradley had fared hardly at the expense of Lanagan
on more than one occasion. I was about to
fling it back at him when Lanagan&#8217;s voice interrupted
me. He had entered the room unfortunately
just in time to hear Bradley&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed pause. Lanagan had
a caustic tip to his tongue and they awaited it now.
He studied Bradley without expression, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
against the door sill. But, curiously enough, there
was no outburst. It was always difficult to foresay
just what form Lanagan&#8217;s humour would take.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charley,&#8221; he said at last to Bradley, and there
shaded into his voice a subtle colouring of unconscious
pathos, &#8220;What have I ever done to you? I
have never done you dirt; nor any man in the business
dirt. I have played the game square. Why
is it that I am always singled out like that? Have
I ever betrayed my paper or my friends? Have I
ever brought dishonour to the name of the newspaperman?
If I have drunk, it has been out of the
public sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have fought hard, Charley; fought hard to
break the habit. It belongs to a past day in our
game. And irrespective of that I may wish to be
remembered around here some day as something
other than drunken Jack Lanagan. I can&#8217;t help it
if I have a knack of landing stories. I&#8217;ve got to
play the game right with my paper, haven&#8217;t I?
And here in this reporters&#8217; room of all places I
thought for a little lift and a hand along and you
are trying to shove me down.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice hardened in bitterness:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve played a lone hand all my life, though,
Charley; it seems to be in the cards that I keep it
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>My eyes blurred because I alone knew how hard
he had fought that battle. Beneath his cynical exterior
he had a soul as sensitive to slights as a girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Boyishly I made a lunge at Bradley, but Lanagan,
with a swift move, had my arm in that lean, powerful
hand of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t go,&#8221; he said, softly. &#8220;We are full
grown men.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Then Merriman,
of few words, said sententiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your move, Charley.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bradley put out his hand, which Lanagan
took.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said the <i>Herald</i> man, &#8220;I&#8217;m a cad. There
isn&#8217;t a righter man in the game than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget it then,&#8221; said Lanagan. &#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as we left the reporters&#8217; room together I noticed
that the whiteness that had come over Lanagan&#8217;s
face remained there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it worry you, Jack,&#8221; I said anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you bother, laddie. He did me more
good than liquor, and I never felt the dragging for
the stuff worse than to-night. I&#8217;m going into this
story now for fair, and I&#8217;m going in to smash the
<i>Times</i> and the <i>Herald</i> flatter than a matrix.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ratto case was one that occupied considerable
public attention several years ago, interest arising
in the first instance through the peculiar manner
in which the crime was disclosed. Ratto, a wealthy
Italian commission merchant, had disappeared, no
great commotion being raised for the first few days.
The police made the customary desultory &#8220;search&#8221;&mdash;the
&#8220;search&#8221; consisting mainly of the name and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
description of Ratto being read out at the watches
in the various station-houses. The mystery in the
disappearance might have remained unsolved for
weeks had it not been for a lineman, Waters, who,
perched on the cross-tree of a telegraph pole commanding
a view of the windows of a room in the
vacant house where Ratto&#8217;s dead body lay, made
the discovery. No policeman being in the vicinity,
Waters, with residents of the vicinity, entered the
house.</p>

<p>There had followed much newspaper speculation
and police deduction. The Mafia and the Camorra
came in for attention, the latter organisation being
one that was at that time&mdash;long before the Viterbo
trials&mdash;just coming to the attention of the American
regular police and the secret service, as counterfeiting
of American currency formed one of the
Camorra accomplishments.</p>

<p>The peculiar interest in the manner in which the
Ratto killing was discovered was this: three months
previously a crime had been discovered under almost
identical circumstances by the same lineman,
Waters. In that case Rosendorn, a Jewish tailor,
was found after a several days&#8217; disappearance by
Waters, at work on the lines, who happened to see
the body as he glanced through the window of a
vacant house from his elevated perch. Following
the discovery of the body by Waters the case had
been speedily cleared up by the police and proved to
be an affair arising from conjugal jealousy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Waters was a man well advanced in years. The
strain of the appearance at the coroner&#8217;s jury and
the preliminary hearings in the police court appeared
slightly to unbalance his mind. The spectacle of
the murdered man that he beheld through the windows
of the vacant house was constantly before him.
He was a man who had gone through a placid life
and never figured in any scene of shocking violence
or of murder.</p>

<p>After the disposal of the Rosendorn case Waters
became possessed of a mania for climbing telegraph
poles commanding the windows of vacant houses.
Here and there and everywhere about the city he
might be seen spiking himself up a pole, peering
intently, and scuttling down. He was a familiar
figure to all policemen and many citizens. He made
a practice of haunting police headquarters, and, his
imagination beginning evidently to visualise the first
scene, once or twice led futile parties into vacant
houses with the declaration that he had discovered a
body. The police reporters humoured him and he
came to know the most of them, particularly Lanagan,
who found Waters&#8217; case was of profound interest.
Several stories were written about him and
his self-appointed cross-beam task of discovering
murdered people in vacant houses.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;he &#8220;made good.&#8221; Weeks of poking
and prying and shinning up and down telegraph
poles brought their reward and Waters discovered
another crime: that of Ratto. He had been slain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
with an ordinary blackjack, which was found by
the body.</p>

<p>During the three days of excitement following
the discovery of the commission merchant&#8217;s body
Waters thrived upon the publicity that he received.
He carried bundles of papers containing accounts
of his &#8220;find&#8221; and with his picture taken in many
ways: climbing up telegraph poles, peering into a
window from a cross-tree&mdash;a camera man nearly
lost his life slipping on a cross beam taking this
picture, and as he looked ten years ago, his last
&#8220;gallery&#8221; picture unearthed &#8220;exclusively&#8221; by a
proud &#8220;cub&#8221; reporter. He was as tickled as a boy,
and it was confidently predicted around police headquarters
that he would find an end in an insane
asylum from pure joy in a month.</p>

<p>But the Ratto case did not clear up quite as easily
as had the Rosendorn case. It will be recalled in
San Francisco that a swift night ride in the police
launch to Black Diamond had resulted in the arrest
of Bernardo Tosci, claimed by the police to be the
leader of the Camorra in the west. A police theory
of attempted blackmail by that organisation seemed
to have been well bolstered up. The local ramifications
of the Camorra were proved beyond all
doubt. Mysterious persons, suspected of being Camorra
agents, who had been seen talking to Ratto
shortly before his disappearance, were being diligently
sought. The fear of the Camorra by the
residents of the Latin quarter seriously hindered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the police and newspaper men in their work, even
the native-speaking Italian detail of upper officemen
making little progress against the terror that the
shadow of the Camorra threw upon the quarter.
Police and newspaper judgment were slowly settling
that Ratto&#8217;s death was due to one of those far-reaching
conspiracies of the Camorra chieftain and
his minions.</p>

<p>Such was the situation at midnight when Lanagan
and I dropped out of the reporters&#8217; room. The
arrest of Tosci&mdash;that we had been &#8220;scooped&#8221; on&mdash;had
been made shortly after midnight the night
before. A sullen &#8220;hunch&#8221; on Lanagan&#8217;s part that
the crime was in no way reminiscent of the methods
of the Camorra, as he understood those methods
from a mass of inquiry and first-hand reading, had
led us away from the police headquarters just a few
moments before Tosci had been slipped up the back
elevator and placed in detinue. The man regularly
assigned to the night police detail at the Hall of Justice,
a new man on the &#8220;beat,&#8221; had missed the arrest,
working against seasoned men on the <i>Times</i>
and the <i>Herald</i> with their inside sources of prison
information. However, we were supposed to be
doing the &#8220;heavy&#8221; work on the story, so the burden
of the &#8220;trimming&#8221; fell upon us.</p>

<p>Lanagan was morose. He had nothing more to
say as we walked down Kearney street and turned
up Broadway. I thought he was going to Cæsar&#8217;s&mdash;the
original Cæsar&#8217;s with the two tables and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
marvellous cuisine that pioneered the way for the
glaring café chantant of to-day&#8217;s slumming parties,&mdash;but
he walked rapidly past Cæsar&#8217;s and on to turn
in at Bresci&#8217;s, a short distance up the slope of Telegraph
Hill. It was a dirty little place, one of the
corner &#8220;wine joints&#8221; sprinkled thickly in out of
the way pockets of the congested Latin quarter. At
Bresci&#8217;s, in addition to the bar, there was a little
eating place at the rear, separated from the bar by
dingy curtains. One room further back held a
piano, where on occasion one might hear his ash
man, or the flower vendor from Third and Market
streets, or a waiter off duty from the downtown
cafés, volume forth the Prologue or swing faultlessly
through the Toreador&#8217;s song.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just got a tip that they are trying to hook mine
host Bresci into the thing as a Camorra leader,&#8221; was
all that Lanagan said.</p>

<p>We sat at one of the tables while Lanagan pulled
the faded curtains almost together. Madam Bresci,
she of the famed sauté mêlé, was indisposed, so
the daughter, Bina, would serve us, if agreeable?
Perfectly so, said Lanagan, rather with a note of
satisfaction it struck me, though when I glanced at
his face in some surprise, for he was a man who was
ordinarily unmoved of women, it was expressionless.</p>

<p>Bresci went on to his bar after giving orders at
the kitchen, and we sat there some time in silence;
long enough for Lanagan to send the nicotine of
three evil Manilas to his lungs. I saw that his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
never left the opening through the curtains. Then
his cigar, from his mouth for the moment, was
suspended in air on its travel back and I followed his
sharp glance through the curtain.</p>

<p>Dinoli and Alberta, two plain-clothes men detailed
in the Latin quarter, had entered the saloon. Instantly
the babble from the voices of many volatile
Italians ceased. The saloon on the moment became
quiet, save for the rattling of glasses and one click
of the old-fashioned maplewood cash register. The
detectives passed the time with Bresci, casually
&#8220;sized up&#8221; the gathering, missing Lanagan and
myself, and left. Instantly there broke forth a riot
of sputtering Italian. The word &#8220;Ratto&#8221; we
heard and then, obviously at some motion toward
our curtains from Bresci, the babble stopped as suddenly
as it began and within five moments the
throng had idled out and the saloon was still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bresci,&#8221; demanded Lanagan suddenly, &#8220;what
were they saying out there about Ratto? Were
they Camorrists?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bresci&#8217;s hand went straight over his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Corpo di Christo! Non! Non!</i>&#8221; he exclaimed,
paling. &#8220;Oh, never speek such word here! Non!
They say, too bad Ratto he keeled!&#8221;</p>

<p>He mopped his brow of its perspiration, suddenly
started, and glanced furtively through the curtains
to see whether anyone had come in and heard the
conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re a liar, Bresci,&#8221; said Lanagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
pleasantly. &#8220;But as I can&#8217;t talk Italian, I can&#8217;t
prove it. It&#8217;s pretty funny how that pow-wow shut
up the minute those coppers blew through that door.
But you better wipe your streaming brow again and
beat it back to the bar. You&#8217;ve got a customer.
Who is&mdash;&#8221; Lanagan whispered to me as Bresci
left, &#8220;no other than Lawrence Morton of the secret
service, just assigned here from Seattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he continued, &#8220;I met him the other day on
that counterfeiting story at the beach. Just a shade
curious, I should say, the attention Bresci is attracting
to-night from the big and the little hawkshaws.
It bears out my &#8216;tip.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton had a drink or two, complained of being
tired, and drifted casually over to the curtains,
opened them, saw us, and was backing easily away
when Lanagan called out from the darkness&mdash;he
had turned off the incandescent earlier:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, Morton. Nothing to get exclusive
over,&#8221; switching on the light.</p>

<p>Morton dropped into a chair. If he was perturbed
at being &#8220;made&#8221; he did not show it. He
was generally reputed one of the two or three cleverest
operators in the government service.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was good work you did on Iowa Slim,
from all I hear,&#8221; he vouchsafed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a better coming up,&#8221; replied Lanagan,
indifferently. &#8220;What brings you to Bresci&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the two rules of our department?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>&#8220;Guard the president and turn up counterfeiters,&#8221;
said Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Lanagan, you&#8217;ve got the cachet to me
from a good friend. The secret service man loses
his job who talks; but I don&#8217;t mind taking a chance
with you and telling you in confidence that in this
particular case I&#8217;m not guarding the president; being
as he is, as you know, in Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t been sampling any&mdash;er&mdash;<i>salami</i>?&#8221;
drawled Lanagan.</p>

<p>Morton laughed. &#8220;You sure are a clever one at
that. No. I haven&#8217;t come across any that suited
my palate. I&#8217;m particular.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had a <i>café royale</i>&mdash;with Lanagan pouring
his thimble-full of cognac in my glass&mdash;and Morton
left.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Camorra, it develops,&#8221; said Lanagan,
&#8220;have been shipping to this country from &mdash;&mdash;
excellent counterfeit American bank notes. They
ship them in <i>salami</i> sausages. Maybe if one has
gone astray we will get a slice of bank note with our
<i>salami</i> and <i>sauté</i>, for here it comes on a tray with
the fair Bina serving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bina, Bresci&#8217;s daughter, was an Italian of absolute
beauty; one of those glowing faces and perfect
forms you see in the old Italian masters.</p>

<p>I noticed in a moment that the comely Bina had
much attention to show Lanagan. We finished our
meal and Lanagan led the way to the inner room,
where the piano was located. I had heard him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
different times sputter out &#8220;rag,&#8221; but when Nevin&#8217;s
&#8220;A Day in Venice&#8221; suite came breathing softly
beneath his finger tips from out of that wrangly
piano I could but listen in amazement. Man of
mysterious beginnings, he had dropped into the San
Francisco newspaper game over night, been given
his &#8220;try-out&#8221; by the brotherhood, found to speak
the language of the tribe, and had thereafter been
unconditionally accepted. Such a mess as the Bradley
affair only served to emphasise his leadership.</p>

<p>With the last fine chord of the <i>Buona Notte</i> there
was a stillness broken only by the instant and
ecstatic handclapping of Bina. If I ever saw the
thing called Love shine forth from the human eyes,
it suddenly illuminated those dusky eyes that moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Madonna! Madonna!&#8221; she cried, softly.
&#8220;Encore! Encore!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan zipped through a lustspeil, to drop back
then to the Last Composition. It was truly remarkable,
the manner in which he brought the encroaching
blindness of the great Beethoven sobbing out of
the misery of the minor base.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did a lot of that sort of thing when I was
younger,&#8221; he said, apologetically. &#8220;Before the
wanderlust hit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was through. Bina fluttered about him and
Lanagan&#8217;s head was close to hers. She was a full-sexed
creature but young; and I balked. I spoke
to Lanagan sharply after a moment or two and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
departed. She gave him a shy little glance as he
left.</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;What a Covenanter you are! A
psalm singer gone wrong for fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; I said, stubbornly, but with the
best of intentions. &#8220;She&#8217;s only a child.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t
yet know all the sides of this man Lanagan.</p>

<p>He whirled on me: and I got a swift sense of the
power that could flash from those dark eyes, and I
felt, with the intimacy of personal experience, how
effective they must be when working upon a guilty
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you, Howard,&#8221; he bit out, using my
given name for the first time in our friendship,
&#8220;Norrie&#8221; being his ordinary salutation, &#8220;that I&#8217;m
working on the Ratto story. Get me? What do
you take me for, anyhow? I&#8217;ve stood one welt
from my own kind to-night and I don&#8217;t want another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan received his second apology of the night;
but he didn&#8217;t appear to want it at that. His uncanny
faculty of reading men&#8217;s minds seemed to tell
him that my remark was in good faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget it,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But just for that,
Norrie, I&#8217;ll keep to myself for the present the interesting
bit of information that Bina gave me; for
Bresci is a Camorra agent after all, and Bina, who
is all eyes and ears, knows precisely the truth about
Ratto&#8217;s death in so far as it pertains to the Camorra.
I guess that will hold you for a while? But what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
a lover of music she is! Let&#8217;s call it a day. Don&#8217;t
look for me to-morrow. I&#8217;m off on a little lay of
my own. Keep in general reach of a telephone so
I can get you in a hurry and give that slavedriver
of a Sampson my distinguished compliments and
tell him I will show up when it pleases me to get
d&mdash;&mdash; good and ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hammered away at the routine of the story the
next day&mdash;I was just a plain plodder, ordinarily
dependable, but never particularly brilliant&mdash;and
neither saw Lanagan nor heard from him. A lively
angle was given to the story when Dinola and Alberti
discovered, concealed in one of Ratto&#8217;s game
refrigerators, six choice <i>salami</i> sausages that his
death had evidently prevented him disposing of in
the proper way, for neatly rolled in a half-inch wad
in the dead centre of each, was a roll of ten $100
gold bills of U. S. currency.</p>

<p>The secret service men, apprised, raged at the
information being given to the press, claiming that
they had been working to round up the entire gang
for months, and that the publication would serve as
warning to the others. But Leslie, more concerned
with solving the Ratto mystery, and hanging it on
Tosci than with handling Uncle Sam&#8217;s minor details,
and being also a great believer in the assistance intelligent
newspaper publicity could be to the police,
gave the facts out. The facts would appear to link
Ratto indubitably with the Camorra ring engaged in
the importation of counterfeit currency and obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
eliminated the Camorra blackmail theory with
respect to his death.</p>

<p>With Ratto now definitely established as a leader
of the slippery Camorra&mdash;it was a hard organisation
to get definite proof on&mdash;the police were
thrown back on a theory of a fight between Camorra
leaders, possibly over some division of the profits
or some breach of faith. The Camorra history
shows that it was not&mdash;nor is not&mdash;slow to take
vengeance even on its own people.</p>

<p>Lanagan was missing the next day again, and I
was surprised, in view of the sensational developments.
I was following the police lead and it all
pointed to the Camorra to me. Nor did he appear
for work the third day nor give me word of himself.
And on this day the police had an admission from
Tosci that he had visited Ratto on the evening of
his disappearance!</p>

<p>It may be well to say here, too, that the secret
service men, although working at cross-purposes
with the regular police, had been putting the screws
to Tosci and Morton had finally gotten enough information
to supplement his own investigations, and
in a swift swoop five members of the Tosci gang
were in the federal cells at the Oakland jail charged
with handling counterfeit money.</p>

<p>All in all, the situation was growing highly complex
for a routine plodder, and still no Lanagan! I
had just about made up my mind to go on a still
hunt for him, confident that he must have broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
his vows of abstinence, when he called me up. His
message was curt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Suggest to Sampson to stick personally until he
hears from me. Meet me at once at Hyde and
Lombard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sampson usually left the office at midnight. Lanagan
preferred his dynamic energy on the desk when
a big smash was on; and when he asked for Sampson
personally I knew he had landed. And Sampson
always preferred being at the city desk when
Lanagan was swinging home on the bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine work!&#8221; was all Sampson said; it was not
in his cold-blooded cosmos to show disinterested
enthusiasm. Possibly it was that characteristic,
coupled with twenty years&#8217; seasoning at the wheel,
that made him the greatest city editor in the West.</p>

<p>Lanagan&#8217;s clothes had that peculiarly hand-dog
appearance that the newest suit will get when a man
has slept in it once or twice; and Lanagan&#8217;s clothes
were seldom new, so the appearance was emphasised.
He had evidently found no time either to
shave or change his collar. Worn lines were about
his mouth and eyes such as you see in athletes who
have &#8220;pulled off&#8221; weight in hard training. But
his eyes, those dark, mesmeric eyes, were sparkling
and the old engaging trick of smiling was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Began to think maybe I <i>had</i> &#8216;lost my grip,&#8217;&#8221;
he said, with a short laugh. &#8220;But I have either
turned up one of the finest police stories in my time
or I have gone plumb crazy. We will soon know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Without more words, he walked quickly several
blocks down over the eastern slope of the hill and
turned into a narrow tradesman&#8217;s alley. I noticed
that he was watching keenly before and after us.
He slipped through a gate in a high board fence
and we were in a yard overgrown with shrubbery
and weeds. The house was a corner one and of
that familiar type of old family residence, seen in
most localities, that has gone to seed on a mortgage.
It was vacant. He opened the kitchen door with a
skeleton key and we walked upstairs, turning into
a large room commanding a view of the street. He
kept away from the window, I noticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Draw up the Morris chair,&#8221; he said facetiously,
as he squatted on his legs. I sat down against the
wall and pulled out a cigar but he stopped me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t take a chance. Smell of smoke might
give the whole thing away. See anything curious
about this room?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at the bareness of it and shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Examine it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t even
looked it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew he was not given to joking, so I got up
and went over the room carefully. The door to
the hall was swung back against the wall and I
closed it.</p>

<p>Hanging on the door knob by the leather wrist
thong was a blackjack, a duplicate of the one with
which Ratto was slain. Lanagan was laughing
quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>&#8220;What are your sensations at being in a prospective
death chamber?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Visions of being suddenly pocketed in that vast,
out of the way mansion by a ring of Camorrists,
assailed me, and I instinctively felt for my revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said the baffling Lanagan. &#8220;The
trap won&#8217;t spring for several hours yet. But after
it does spring,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;and this mess is over,
I&#8217;m prepared to present the fair Bina with the biggest
box of French mixed in town. That is,&#8221; quizzically,
&#8220;if my puritanical Mentor will permit me
to? But seriously, Norrie,&#8221;&mdash;his next words came
forth rather hurriedly, and much as a shamed school-boy
might make a confession,&mdash;&#8220;seriously these
Italian girls are mature women at sixteen. And
though you may not think it, I am only thirty-four.&#8221;</p>

<p>When it filtered into me what he was driving at
I jumped to my feet and pulled him to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; I cried delightedly, &#8220;you don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, shortly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean anything,
now or any other time, Norrie, until I&#8217;ve taken a
seat on this water wagon that I know I can ride for
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>My thoughts shot back to that declaration in the
reporters&#8217; room that I had pondered often since
uttered. It was clear enough now. He was a
man&#8217;s man, Jack Lanagan; and looking back now
even after the years that have passed since then,
looking back from the content of my own cosy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
home, the tears spring and I stop writing. He did
not marry Bina.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about enough of that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
wanted you to get the lay of the house by daylight.
Let&#8217;s get out of here. I&#8217;ve got to see Leslie.&#8221;</p>

<p>But we were only as far as the head of the stairs
leading to the lower floor when a key grated in a
lock some place beneath us and Lanagan gripped
my arm, his finger to his lips, his eyes glittering
like a snake&#8217;s. We swung back on tiptoes
to a small closet at the end of the hall, pulling the
door almost shut after us. Lanagan dropped, his
eye to the keyhole. He had drawn his revolver and
I drew mine; my heart was beginning to thump
like a big bass drum. There came to my ears the
sound of footfalls up the creaking stairs. At first
it seemed like a dozen men and I concluded for once
that one of Lanagan&#8217;s traps was going to spring the
wrong way.</p>

<p>The footfalls disintegrated as they came nearer
and I found there was but one person. Lanagan&#8217;s
eye might have been stuck fast to that keyhole, for
his hat brim did not waver the fraction of an inch
as he held his rigid, cramped position for long minute
after minute.</p>

<p>Finally the footfalls sounded back down the stairs.
Lanagan did not move until, to our taut ear drums,
came the sound of the closing rear door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked him, wiping the perspiration
from my forehead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>All he said was &#8220;Fine! Fine! Wait a bit yet,
Norrie! That was merely a scout, taking a last
look to be sure that blackjack hadn&#8217;t been removed
by any prospective tenants who might have been
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at his dollar watch. It was six
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be two good hours before darkness,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take a chance and leave the house
uncovered while I get hold of the chief. Unless
you want to stay here?&#8221; he asked banteringly. I
did not want to stay there, but he had me squarely
in the door, as it were, and I had to say I would if
he wanted it. I sometimes think many a man is
made a hero against his will. Then a great shaft
of illumination struck me and I asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Jack; why should they bring that blackjack
here? They could bring a dozen with them
and nobody be any the wiser.&#8221;</p>

<p>But all the satisfaction I got out of that inscrutable,
irritating man was: &#8220;How bright the understudy
is becoming! You&#8217;ll be tackling high C yourself
next!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to permit
you to remain here. Firstly and mainly, because
I am confident nothing will happen until after
dark, although for a moment I thought my theory
had gone wrong, and in the second place, because
you might scramble the whole platter on me and get
to shooting recklessly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>We slipped out of the alley after Lanagan had
reconnoitred long. He had good reason for not
wishing to appear at police headquarters. It was
generally known that he was off on some sort of a
still hunt. He had been seen occasionally by some
of the boys, and it was known, too, that he was not
drinking. His appearance at headquarters in conference
with Leslie therefore might bring a corps
of sharp-eyed newspaper men on our trail.</p>

<p>He got Leslie on the wire, and within thirty minutes
was in deep conversation with that astute thief-taker
in the rear room at Allenberg&#8217;s. There were
few sections of the city where Lanagan was not on
intimate terms with saloonmen. There are many
times when they can be valuable to the police reporter,
particularly in the Tenderloin and down
town. The two did not take me into their confidence,
but once I heard Leslie say, explosively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, you&#8217;re as daffy as a horned toad.&#8221;</p>

<p>I caught only part of Lanagan&#8217;s answer. He was
talking earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, Chief, my information is correct.
I&#8217;ve got the only leak in San Francisco into the
Camorra and neither you nor the secret service have
a man who can tap it. It&#8217;s worth a chance, I tell
you. We&#8217;ll want Brady, Wilson and Maloney.
We&#8217;ve got to cover every point, take no chances of
a murder getting by on us, and smash this thing
right on the nose.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Leslie studied Lanagan long and carefully. He
had never been wrong yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not drinking, Jack?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a smell in three months,&#8221; said Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on,&#8221; the chief finally said, decisively.</p>

<p>I grew restive at not being taken &#8220;in,&#8221; but Lanagan
said I was becoming so very bright that a little
discipline would do me good; harkening back, I suppose,
to that remark about the blackjack. I said
no more. They outlined their plan. Maloney was
to hide in the yard of the house directly across from
the alley gate&mdash;in that old-fashioned neighbourhood,
tight board fences and hedgerows are common&mdash;and
Wilson across the street where he could command
the window to the room where the blackjack
hung. We three, with Brady, were to take our position
inside the house. The moment anybody entered
the alley gate, or by the front door&mdash;Lanagan
considered it likely that that approach might be
taken under cover of darkness&mdash;Maloney was to
lift himself to the fence top and strike a match.
Wilson, in turn, as though lighting a cigar, would
strike a match, and one or the other of us, watching
back from the room window of the house, would
know that the trap was set. In addition to watching
for Maloney&#8217;s signal, Wilson&#8217;s position enabled
him easily to cover the front door. Lanagan, it
appeared, had planned the coup hours before and
had his coverts already selected.</p>

<p>Their vigil ended on the outside, Maloney and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Wilson were then to jump and cover the front and
rear doors, respectively, in case of any miscue inside
that might permit of an escape. &#8220;Miscue&#8221; was
Lanagan&#8217;s word: and I reflected with some apprehension,
that any &#8220;miscue&#8221; with such nervy officers
as Leslie and Brady that would permit an escape
out of that house would mean that probably all
of us would be candidates for morgue slabs.</p>

<p>Dusk found us all drifting one by one to our stations.
When I finally entered through the alley
door, I could see neither Maloney nor Wilson, and
yet I knew they had both gone before me and were
in position. I was the last one in and Lanagan was
waiting there to lock the kitchen door after me. We
trooped silently upstairs, shoes off and in hand.</p>

<p>It was an unreal situation, waiting there as the
deeper blackness of night settled down and the night
sounds of an empty house assailed us magnified.
Brady was standing the watch at the window for
the signal. The rest of us were lined up in the
broad hall. It was so dark you couldn&#8217;t see a man
a foot in front of you. Hours it seemed to me
must have passed, with no conversation save a scattered
whisper or so. We had tried the hall and
room floors and the door to the hall closet and they
gave out no squeaks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Psst!&#8221;</p>

<p>Softly, sibilantly, came Brady&#8217;s signal. We
backed into the closet. Brady in a second was with
us. The door was opened six inches with Lanagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and Leslie ready for a spring. I was in some
fashion away back in the rear of the closet.</p>

<p>A key grated in the kitchen lock, and it sounded
through the vast empty house with a peculiarly sinister
harshness. It was a situation certainly unique
in crime! The stairs creaked&mdash;there was the
sound of heavy, laboured breathing. But there was
but one set of footfalls! We heard the door open
to the room where the ugly blackjack hung, and as
it did Leslie swung our door out and, silently as so
many black ghosts, we moved to the other door.</p>

<p>Against the window we could see a man&#8217;s form
dimly outlined. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a flash of blinding brilliance, a report
that crashed in the empty stillness of the abandoned
mansion with the reverberation of a twelve-pound
gun, and under the arcs of the swiftly flashing
pocket lights of Brady and Leslie, we beheld,
stretched almost at our feet as the form toppled
backward and stiffened out&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Waters!</i></p>

<p>There was a gushing wound in the temple. Death
had been instantaneous. With an eagerness that
was more animal than human, Lanagan tore back
Waters&#8217; coat, ran his hands swiftly through his
every pocket, and finally, with a &#8220;<i>Ha!</i>&#8221; of satisfaction
like a snarl, pulled out from an unsealed envelope
in an inside pocket a page of writing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Daffy, chief: Daffy, as a horned toad? Well,
here&#8217;s the proof!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Written in the hand and phraseology of a fairly
intelligent man, it was as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I killed Ratto. I guess I have been crazy. I
went crazy looking for murdered people in vacant
houses from telegraph poles. I couldn&#8217;t find any
more, and then I thought I would kill somebody. I
told Ratto on the street that I had seen a man&#8217;s body
in that house and he went in with me. I had never
seen him before. I had left the door open as I ran
out to him, but he didn&#8217;t suspect anything. I killed
him with a blackjack and then found the body in
three days, from the telegraph pole. I had picked
out the place several days ahead. I got everything
ready and came up several times and it was funny
no one saw me. I thought Ratto would say get the
police but he was nervy all right and jumped right
in after me.</i></p>

<p>&#8221;<i>The room in this house I discovered in the
same way. It was even better than the flat where
Ratto was killed because the neighbourhood didn&#8217;t
have so many people. The blackjack is on the
door knob. I put it there so as I went into the
room first to light a match I could take it off the
inside door knob and hit my man as he followed
me in.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That reporter Lanagan and another man were
hanging around this neighbourhood to-day. He
has been talking to me kind of suspicious lately and
I guess the jig is up. It&#8217;s funny the police never
suspected me.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>&#8221;<i>I guess I have been crazy all right. I would
hang anyhow. But I am all right now and I will
kill myself in the room. It&#8217;s all the return I can
make for Ratto. If nobody hears the shot I hope
somebody finds me from a telegraph pole. It will
give the newspapers lots to write about. That&#8217;s
what made me crazy. I got too much fame, I
guess.</i></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<i>William Waters</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a prolonged pause. Then:</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; growled Leslie savagely. &#8220;The
&#8216;fame&#8217; you got isn&#8217;t a marker to the fame that reporter
Lanagan has heaped on me. For the original
ass I&#8217;m it. I took that fellow for a loon.
Jack, shake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan could not forbear a soft sarcasm.
That &#8220;daffy as a horned toad&#8221; rankled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give your men a little class in Kraft-Ebing,
Lombroso, Nordau or some of those specialists and
you will get a better understanding of the pulling
power of crime,&#8221; he said, dryly. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t figured
quite this kind of a finish,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;But
the minute he blazed that shot into his brain I was
sure he had left a confession. If he couldn&#8217;t get
notoriety in life he would in death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly Lanagan told of his suspicions settling
on Waters after Bina, his &#8220;leak&#8221; to the Camorra,
had told him that the death of Ratto was as much
of a mystery to the Camorrists as it was to the
police. With Bresci a Camorra leader, the wise-eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and wise-eared little Bina heard and saw much
that Lanagan in turn was told. On her say-so, he
had absolutely dismissed the Camorra. He set
himself to watch Waters and for three days and
nights scarcely ever let the lineman out of his sight.
From safe vantage points he had watched Waters
at his grisly work of climbing innumerable telegraph
poles. At times he had casually picked him
up and talked with him. It was evident that he
had also aroused Waters&#8217; suspicions. He noticed
him lingering in the neighbourhood of the house
where we now were and finally sneak in by the
alley door. After he left the house Lanagan had
hunted up a locksmith, secured a set of skeleton
keys himself, and let himself into the house, not
knowing exactly what to expect.</p>

<p>He found the blackjack on the door knob, saw the
telegraph pole out of the window and in a flash
had realised the entire plan of the crazed lineman.</p>

<p>Lanagan assumed that Waters would not attempt
to lure his victim in daylight. He had come back
to the house while we were there merely moved by
some insane morbidity to visit again the scene
selected for the crime; picture possibly the slain
man on the floor, himself peering in from the
telegraph pole; and then the columns of newspaper
space. That the room was commanded by a telegraph
pole I had not noticed during the day or even
my sluggish wits might have given me a hint of
the truth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>&#8220;The shot seems to have raised no stir outside,
Chief,&#8221; said Lanagan, briskly, when the recital was
done. &#8220;Call in Wilson and Maloney and stick
around and give us two hours lee-way before you
get the morgue. It&#8217;s twelve-thirty.</p>

WHOM THE GODS DESTROY</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT Riordan&#8217;s, much frequented by policemen
and reporters, Jack Lanagan sat with Leslie,
that greatest chief of his time, discussing one of
Dan&#8217;s delectable Bismarck herrings and a &#8220;steam.&#8221;
It was not above the very human Leslie to mingle
in the free democracy of Dan&#8217;s back room, where
the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate foregathered
to settle in seasoned nonchalance the problems of
the world.</p>

<p>Leslie was speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t lost out, Jack,&#8221; he was saying.
&#8220;But if that narrow-gauge Sampson elects to fire
you&mdash;which I know he won&#8217;t&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you work
if I&#8217;ve got to pay you out of my contingent fund.
Get off that suisses diet and report. The <i>Enquirer</i>
can&#8217;t afford to lose you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan, unshaven for a week, looked otherwise
disreputable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Enquirer</i>,&#8221; he reported judicially, &#8220;can
afford to lose anybody. It&#8217;s a sweat-shop life, reporting;
and they fill your place just as easily as
Schwartz, down there on Stevenson Street, fills a
place at one of his shirt machines. Nothing is as
dead as a yesterday&#8217;s paper&mdash;excepting it has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
libel in it; and nothing is so perishable as a reporter&#8217;s
reputation. The slate is swabbed clean
once every twenty-four hours. Your job is precisely
that long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rats. You&#8217;re in a beautiful humour. They
can&#8217;t forget that Iowa Slim exclusive very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but only because of the fact that I haven&#8217;t
shown up for work since. They had given me
warning before then. I&#8217;m through unless they send
for me, and they don&#8217;t seem to be doing that. As
a matter of cold-blooded fact, the <i>Enquirer</i> likes
my work but not my weakness. My type don&#8217;t get
much sympathy these times. I belong to the generation
of the tramp printer; the days of a real
ethical code in the profession. We old-timers are
taking the gad&mdash;what few of us there are left&mdash;three
times over for an even break with these peg-topped
trouser boys at ten a week who once wrote
a class farce.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, chief,&#8221; concluded Lanagan dispassionately
and deliberately, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve shot my bolt in San
Francisco. I&#8217;ll ship on a banana boat and flag it on
to Panama. Maybe when I get there I will tangle
up in some big complication and another Davis will
come along to chronicle me with that other Derelict;
a grand story, by the way, chief&mdash;a newspaper
epic. You should read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie ignored the morose mood of the reporter.
&#8220;Shot nothing,&#8221; he said in disgust. &#8220;Take a Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
bath and sweat that grouch out of your system.
Here, take this ten. I want you to get back to your
paper. You&#8217;re too valuable a man to be out of
work in this town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan rejected the proffered money, and Leslie
was attempting to force it on him&mdash;there was a
warm bond of friendship between the two men and
a mutual admiration for the abilities of each other&mdash;when
when Brady from the upper office stuck his head
through the door. He saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Cook sent me over to say that it looks
now like that Hemingway case was not a suicide
after all. There are no powder burns on the face.
The revolver must have been put in her hand after
she was shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cook was night captain of detectives. Leslie
jumped to his feet and swung Lanagan to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! This will put you on your mettle. I
didn&#8217;t like the looks of that case from the start.
I am going out and take hold of it personally.
Come along. Maybe you can turn up something
that the <i>Enquirer</i> will be glad to hear from you on.
Come along, Brady.&#8221;</p>

<p>They jumped into the police machine and were
whirled out to a fashionable home on Pacific Avenue.
It was 9:30 o&#8217;clock. Less than an hour before
a report had been received of the suicide of
the daughter of the house, a débutante whose coming-out
party had been an event of the spring before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and whose engagement to a broker, Oliver
Macondray, had just been announced.</p>

<p>Wilson, accounted one of Leslie&#8217;s shrewdest
upper office men, was already in the room when
Leslie, Lanagan, and Brady arrived. There were
there also a shoal of newspaper men and photographers,
and the smell of flash powders was heavy
on the air. On the first report from police headquarters
I had been sent out by Sampson and had already
been in the house for half an hour. But I
was glad to surrender the story promptly to Lanagan
when he entered, although he did not then say
that he intended going to work.</p>

<p>It was Wilson, as I recall it, who had raised a
doubt of the suicide theory by pointing out the absence
of powder burns, although the bullet wound
was in the right temple and the revolver clasped
tightly in the right hand. A girl with her frail
wrist must have pressed the revolver close before
firing. It was clear the revolver had been placed
in her hand after the shooting. It was an English
bulldog of old pattern, one of those &#8220;family&#8221;
pistols found in most homes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i107.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Then Lanagan took his leisurely turn, drawing up an easy chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t be first on the ground, be last,&#8221;
was an axiom of the newspaper business that Lanagan
often tried to impress upon me. He proceeded
to act upon his theory now by rolling and lighting
a cigarette to give all in the room ample time to
finish their investigation. Finally the room was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
cleared of all save, Leslie, Lanagan, Brady, Wilson,
and myself.</p>





<p>The room had one set of French windows giving
out upon a wide porch and a heavily matted lawn.
It would be next to impossible to say whether a person
had escaped over the lawn by way of the veranda.
The bedroom door was open when a maid,
attracted by the shot, had overcome her terror and
run to the room.</p>

<p>At the time of death the only persons in the
house were the mother, daughter, and the maid,
Marie. The maid was in a state bordering on
collapse after the first siege with the detectives and
newspaper men, and Leslie ordered her kept quiet
for an hour. The occasional hysterical cries of the
mother, prostrated in her own room, could be heard.</p>

<p>Leslie examined the body with minute care. The
rest of us had completed our investigations. Then
Lanagan took his leisurely turn, drawing up an
easy chair. Leslie, Brady, and Wilson had stepped
through the window and were examining the porch
and the lawn carefully with their pocket lights.
Lanagan had taken one of the girl&#8217;s hands up in
his. He was examining an old-fashioned bracelet
critically, very critically, it seemed to me. He
flashed a sudden quick glance toward the window;
the chief and the detectives were still busy outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand at the door, Norrie!&#8221; he shot at me
electrically.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>I sprang to put my back to it, to give him a moment&#8217;s
delay in case any of the other newspaper
men should drift back to the room. I had not the
slightest idea what he was after, but I caught a
glitter of fierce interest in his eyes, and I knew him
better than to disobey. I did not see what he did
then, save that he quickly placed something within
his pocketbook, something that didn&#8217;t have much
substance, for he had to rub his thumb and forefinger
to drop it into a piece of paper. Some of
the newspaper men trooped back into the room;
Leslie entered again, frowning in perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Singular, Jack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s your
idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; drawled Lanagan, &#8220;I&#8217;ll save my ideas
for the <i>Enquirer</i>, Chief. I&#8217;ve concluded to go back
to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie stared. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got something,&#8221; he
finally said testily. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something that may save me being driven from
town like a beaten dog, Chief, that&#8217;s all. You
didn&#8217;t want that, you said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you anyhow. You&#8217;re too infernally
clever. Go in and win,&#8221; said the grizzled chief,
but his tone was nettled and there was a natural
trace, possibly, of professional jealousy that he
could not conceal. It had never before happened
that he and Lanagan had started off on an absolutely
even break where it was a straight open-and-shut
proposition of the best detective winning; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
felt that Lanagan had found a clue in that room
that he had overlooked. He was a hard loser. He
went over the room again; he examined the body;
he used his magnifying glass and he scanned the
walls, the carpet, the clothing, inch by inch.</p>

<p>He was still reluctant to give up when the coroner&#8217;s
deputies finally arrived to discharge their
melancholy functions. The mother was still in
hysteria. The maid had calmed somewhat, and
Leslie went to examine her with Wilson and Brady.
Lanagan had drifted out and was sitting on the
moonlit porch, to which the electroliers gave added
brightness.</p>

<p>&#8220;When all those blunderbusses get through with
their heavy work, Norrie, we&#8217;ll have a run in with
the maid,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I seem to be the last man on
the job. Meantime find out for me how many red-haired
people there are about this house or among
the immediate circle of the girl&#8217;s friends. It is a
matter of some importance, because&mdash;&#8221; he carefully
opened the pocketbook, extracted the folded
piece of note paper, and, first assuring himself that
no one was about, pointed&mdash;&#8220;because here are two
broken, half-inch bits of red hair that I take it are
going to play an important part in this case. Remember
the Deveraux case? These were wedged
back of the cameo on her bracelet, and they
got there in her last struggle with whoever shot her.
For the time being at least, then, we will eliminate
all but red-haired people.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a dog&#8217;s hair,&#8221; I suggested hopefully.</p>

<p>Lanagan was on the point of retorting with his
finished sarcasm when the Hemingway limousine,
evidently bringing other members of the family or
relations summoned by word of the mournful occurrence,
rolled up to the brilliantly lighted porte-cochère.
Lanagan&#8217;s eye had travelled swiftly and
fixed upon some object of interest. I followed his
intense gaze.</p>

<p>The chauffeur&#8217;s hair was as flaming as a firebrand.</p>

<p>Lanagan&#8217;s eyes seemed to be boring straight
through the man as the machine came to a stop
almost where we sat. The chauffeur&#8217;s face was
pale, extraordinarily pale, it appeared to me; as he
stopped his machine and shut down the gears, there
was a perceptible evidence of nervousness in his
manner that was possibly entirely natural in view
of the shocking happening of a few hours before
that had taken the life of his young mistress.</p>

<p>The first to leave the motor was a trim, well-groomed
young man, whom we at once recognised,
from the descriptions we had heard, as Macondray.
As he held the door open for the other two persons
to leave the machine, he removed his hat, holding
it in his hand.</p>

<p>Simultaneously our eyes rested on his uncovered
hair.</p>

<p>His hair, if anything, was a shade more auburn
than that of the chauffeur! His swollen eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
pale face were natural under the circumstances,
with his marriage hopes thus painfully blasted.
They walked within, and Lanagan said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on. We&#8217;ll get first crack at this fellow
anyhow. Let&#8217;s meet him back at the garage in
the rear.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had started to walk back to the garage as the
chauffeur cranked his machine when from the same
low window Leslie and Brady stepped alertly.
Leslie held up his hand to the chauffeur. The two
officers were beside him in a moment. I knew
what was coming even before they laid a hand on
him. I had seen too many arrests made not to
know what was meant by that brusque, cool manner,
that quick step, that wary eye even before there
came that familiar terse, short snap of the professional
thief-taker:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We want you!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The maid has spilled!&#8221; was Lanagan&#8217;s ejaculation
as we stepped up to the trio. Leslie could not
forbear a pleased lighting of the eyes as he glanced
at Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got, Chief?&#8221; asked Lanagan
easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The maid, Marie, broke down and admitted
that she let this man Martin into the house and into
the girl&#8217;s room at the girl&#8217;s orders at 8.30 o&#8217;clock.
Possibly ten minutes later, she says, she heard the
shot. When she could summon courage to go to
her mistress&#8217;s room she found her lying on the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
dead, the revolver in her hand. What have you
to say, Martin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, sir,&#8221; said Martin levelly. &#8220;I have
nothing at all to say, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a man of about thirty. Lanagan&#8217;s subsequent
investigations disclosed that he had been
with the Hemingways for many years, formerly
working as a stable boy. When automobiles came
into vogue, he had taken a place as chauffeur. He
was a probation court boy when the Hemingways
took him into their employ and &#8220;made a man of
him,&#8221; as he used to express it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing?&#8221; snapped Leslie. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see.
I guess we&#8217;ll take him in, Brady, and give him the
dark cell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie swung on his heel, and Brady, giving the
chauffeur only time enough to run his machine to
the garage, took him to the city prison and locked
him up. But first I had noticed Lanagan pick up
Martin&#8217;s cap from the seat of the machine while
the brief conference was going on and deftly extract
something from it. The &#8220;something&#8221; proved
later to be one or two of Martin&#8217;s red hairs.</p>

<p>Other newspaper men emerging from the house
had been informed by Leslie of the arrest. It was
11.30 o&#8217;clock by that time, and, with the arrest of
Martin as their sensation, the morning paper men
of one accord shoaled back to their offices. Leslie
turned whatever ends might come up over to Wilson,
with instructions to keep an eye on the maid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Marie, and went back to headquarters satisfied that
if Martin was not the murderer he at least could
clear up the mystery. Lanagan started back with
the rest, but dropped off the car unobserved and
returned to the house. He was not yet satisfied
that all that the inmates knew there had been told.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go in and write the story,&#8221; he had told
me. &#8220;That chauffeur isn&#8217;t the type who is rendezvousing
with the daughter of the house; and she
isn&#8217;t the type to engage in an alliance with a chauffeur.
There is a nigger in this woodpile some
place&mdash;and a red-headed nigger at that. Go off
with your story if you don&#8217;t hear from me by press
time, but keep my red hairs out of your story unless
you hear from me further.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had gathered in my camera man and artist and
hurried back to the office to write a story that I
knew would be exactly similar in its facts with those
in the other morning papers, leading off naturally
with the arrest of the chauffeur.</p>

<p>There were still quite a number of relatives and
family friends at the house when Lanagan returned.
The reception hall was brilliantly lighted, and he
hung up his hat. As he did so he examined Macondray&#8217;s
topcoat carefully and quickly. On the collar
was one hair. It was tucked away, labeled, in
a separate package in the pocketbook.</p>

<p>He went to the room of the murder to find Wilson
there &#8220;sweating&#8221; Macondray. The broker
was bent over a table, sobbing. The intermittent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
hysterical cries of the mother, hoarser and fainter
as exhaustion came upon her, still punctuated the
air. Wilson was reading a letter. He passed it to
Lanagan.</p>

<p>Lanagan read, then, a startling few lines written
by Miss Hemingway the day before to Macondray,
breaking their engagement with the single
explanation: <i>I love another. You surely could not
want to marry a woman who had discovered she
loved another.</i></p>

<p>Lanagan passed the letter back. He was anxious
to make a microscopic examination of the hair, but
he wanted also to put Macondray through a mill.
He signalled Wilson to &#8220;jam,&#8221; and the detective
touched Macondray on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get together,&#8221; he said brusquely. &#8220;We want
you to answer a few questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t getting any place in this fashion,&#8221;
added Lanagan curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Macondray, when did you get that letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Macondray straightened up, wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon at 5 o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you see Miss Hemingway last?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause while Macondray gazed
fixedly first at Lanagan and then at Wilson, as
though trying to read their minds to learn what
they knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you did see her after the letter, you
know,&#8221; said Lanagan quietly. It was entirely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
random shot, but it went home. Macondray
studied the matter over again for some moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said at last slowly, &#8220;I suppose it is
best that I tell all I know. I saw her last&mdash;at half-past
eight o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>His head dropped to his breast and dry sobs
shook him again for a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;But as to her death I can offer no explanation.
Only&mdash;you have Martin in custody, and I saw
Martin in her room at that time. My God!&#8221; he
burst out, &#8220;that Elvira could have sunk so low!
A menial, a lackey&mdash;a chauffeur!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want a dissertation on caste,&#8221; said
Lanagan with cold brutality. &#8220;What we want of
you, Macondray, either here or at the city prison&mdash;&#8221;
Macondray started, realising for the first time
that suspicion was pointing his way&mdash;&#8220;is a simple
statement of how you happened to see Miss Hemingway
in this room with Martin and what happened
after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I received her note by messenger at five o&#8217;clock.
At half-past seven I called, but she was not in. I
wanted a personal explanation. I called again in
an hour. She was home, Marie said, and had gone
to her room for the night and under no circumstances
was to be disturbed. I determined to see
her at any cost. I knew the position of her room
here, fronting on the veranda. I went from the
house by the front door and walked around here to
the lawn. I intended only to attract her attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
by throwing a pebble against the window and compelling
her to speak with me. But while I stood
there on the lawn, searching for a pebble, an automobile
drove slowly down Buchanan Street and
stopped just beyond the Hemingway drive behind
the pepper tree. There were two men in it. One
remained while the other, whom I recognised as
Martin, came to the house, entering by the kitchen
door. Of course, then I would not risk attracting
Elvira&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;While I was just turning to go, Elvira&#8217;s curtain
suddenly was raised, and I saw her peering out
down Buchanan Street toward the place where the
motor car was. Just when that tableau was being
presented her chamber door opened quickly, and
Martin entered. She seemed to be glad to see him,
and extended both her hands to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could witness no more. It broke my heart.
Sick and miserable that I had discovered so fine
a girl, the girl whom I loved sincerely, in a meeting
with her chauffeur, I turned and came away.
That is all I know. Later I received a telephone
message of the tragedy. They sent the car for
me. I could not understand it then; I cannot
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was sobbing again with his arms on the table.</p>

<p>Wilson stepped over to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brace up,&#8221; he said shortly, &#8220;I want you to
come with me. The chief will want to keep you
where he can see you for a day or two.&#8221; His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
heavy hand descended professionally upon Macondray&#8217;s
shoulder. But Lanagan interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a chance, Jim,&#8221; he said, shaking his head.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to interfere with your duty, but I
believe that chap is telling the truth absolutely.
What we want to do now is to clear up the mystery
of the man in the automobile. Martin must be
made to talk. And, by the way, have you come
across any red-haired people in this case outside
Martin and Macondray? It struck me as a good
little feature story. Here&#8217;s a red-haired chauffeur
and a red-haired fiancée. It&#8217;s a combination that
don&#8217;t often occur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; replied Wilson. &#8220;That&#8217;s curious.
The chief and I only saw Mrs. Hemingway for a
moment, she was so unstrung, but she most certainly
has the finest head of red hair for a woman
of forty-four or five you want to see. Seems to
be her own, too. Funny proposition, the three of
them at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan was staring, for once taken completely
by surprise, so pat did the circumstance fit his theories.
He glanced at his watch. His eyes were dancing
with excitement. &#8220;That will be all, Mr. Macondray,
unless Wilson wants you for anything,&#8221;
he said. Wilson said he was through, and Macondray
left the room. &#8220;Now, Jim, let&#8217;s see Marie
again. I&#8217;m collecting red hair; it&#8217;s a fad I have
acquired, and I want one or two of Mrs. Hemingway&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>&#8220;I was never more serious in my life,&#8221; said Wilson,
summoning the maid. He sent her for a brush
containing combings of her mistress&#8217;s hair. She
asked no questions, but did as ordered. The maid
acted like a person in a trance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Holding up to a certain point, and then she will
drop like a plummet,&#8221; thought Lanagan, then aloud:
&#8220;I guess we are all through here, Jim, except one
last fling with the mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no &#8220;last fling&#8221; with the mother.
She had been given a hypodermic, the nurse said,
and was sleeping.</p>

<p>From a neighbourhood bar Wilson telephoned to
Leslie, still waiting at police headquarters to get
a last word from his men. The detective was still
half decided to lock up both Marie and Macondray,
but Leslie said no. Lanagan had borrowed Wilson&#8217;s
magnifying glass and had spread out upon the
bar the different pieces of red hair. He was so
deeply engrossed in making comparisons that he
failed to follow the startling one-sided conversation
going on between Wilson and the chief. Wilson
whirled around from the receiver as Lanagan,
profoundly stirred, carefully tucked away his collection.</p>

<p>&#8220;A child could see it,&#8221; he muttered to himself as
Wilson called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin has spilled! Says he tricked the maid,
who, by the way, is in love with him, into letting
him into Elvira&#8217;s room. There he declared his love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
for her, demanded that she fly with him, and when
she refused seized up the family revolver and shot
her down, maddened by her command that he
realise his place and return to the stables where he
belonged. He escaped through the window after
placing the revolver in her hand. They are going
to book him now for murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan took a long time to digest this bit of
surprising information. He made no comment
other than to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re through for the night now, aren&#8217;t you,
Jim? With Leslie vouching for Martin as the
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;and now I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment after he had been left alone Lanagan
had Leslie on the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief? Lanagan. Hop into your car and
meet me at Farrelly&#8217;s. Bring Martin along. It&#8217;s
quarter to one. Make time. And this is something
absolutely between you and me; me and the
<i>Enquirer</i>. Scoot now, Chief. I&#8217;ve something to
interest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since the incident in the room earlier in the evening
Leslie had been restless about Lanagan. Within
ten minutes the police automobile stopped at
Farrelly&#8217;s. Leslie and Brady, with Martin walking
between them, entered.</p>

<p>Lanagan quickly led the way to the side room.</p>

<p>One grimed incandescent lit the room pallidly.
Around a beer-stained table the four men sat, Martin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
farthest from the door. Lanagan&#8217;s eyes were
fairly snapping as he opened his pocketbook and
spread it out upon the table. From it he extracted
his little papers, each containing a piece or two of
red hair. He laid each separate hair slowly, deliberately,
before them all upon the table. Martin was
watching the performance with eyes that glistened in
the intensity of his interest. Equally absorbed were
Leslie and Brady. Deliberately, precisely, Lanagan
laid out the hairs&mdash;two from the brush of
Mrs. Hemingway, one from the coat collar of Macondray,
two from Martin&#8217;s cap, and the two short
bits from the bracelet of Elvira.</p>

<p>Leslie had understood the pantomime the moment
Lanagan opened his pocketbook and disclosed
the collection of hair. He knew what it was now
that he had overlooked; and, chagrined but alert,
he watched each move that Lanagan made, for the
solution had not yet come. Was it to be Martin?
Leslie hoped professionally, for the sake of his
reputation, that it would be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin,&#8221; said Lanagan, flashing the word out
like a dirk might flash in the sun, &#8220;what did Mrs.
Hemingway ever do to earn your loyalty&mdash;even to
death?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin paled, visibly, even beneath the sick light
of the weak incandescent.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been very good to me, sir. She took
me out of the court&#8217;s custody and gave me a good
home and a good salary. She made a man of me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
when I might have become a jailbird. She has been
a good mistress, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a good mistress,&#8221; came through Lanagan&#8217;s
teeth. &#8220;You&#8217;re loyal. The type of loyal retainer.
You&#8217;re not the type that falls in love with the
daughter of the house. You never loved Elvira;
you never murdered Elvira; and you are concealing
now the name of the murderer, telling a poor weak
lie that could not have stood at the outside for
twenty-four hours! <i>Who killed Elvira?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan had arisen and glowered above the
ashen Martin. Leslie was leaning forward, his
eyes, gimletlike, boring into Martin&#8217;s. Brady
swung around, too, to face him, caught as well under
the spell of fierce magnetism of the newspaper
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tell me</i>,&#8221; Lanagan snarled, &#8220;<i>who was in that
automobile with you last night</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s heavy lips dropped apart while he continued
to stare affrightedly upon the newspaper man.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The mother of that girl found you in Elvira&#8217;s
room with her, making preparations for flight with
whoever was in that machine!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; continued Lanagan, hammering
each word home; &#8220;I will tell you who killed Elvira
Hemingway!&#8221; He leaned swiftly across the table,
bending down and breathing a word into the ear
of Martin. The effect was electrical.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! No&mdash;no&mdash;no! It was I, I tell you;
I and no other! I shot her in my fit of madness!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>He collapsed suddenly, his head sinking on his
breast, still gasping huskily forth his protestations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, then,&#8221; said Lanagan. He held
Brady&#8217;s magnifying glass over the hair&mdash;over the
two hairs from the bracelet and then over the other
specimens. The difference in the texture of the
hair and a difference in colour were apparent under
the microscope even in the ill-lighted room. That
one of the three specimens was similar hair to that
from the bracelet was apparent almost to the naked
eye. Leslie&#8217;s face grew grave. Brady had absolute
unbelief written in his eyes. Martin took
one peering look furtively.</p>

<p>&#8220;That hair,&#8221; said Lanagan, indicating, &#8220;came
from Elvira Hemingway&#8217;s bracelet. It lodged
there in her last struggle with whoever killed her.
This is your hair, Martin; compare it. This is
Macondray&#8217;s; compare it. This is from the
mother&#8217;s head; compare it. A red-haired person
killed Elvira. It was not you&mdash;it was not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Martin had sunk his head into his arms on
the table with a groan. Lanagan waited; Leslie
waited; Brady waited&mdash;experts all at the third degree.
Mind was mauling matter&mdash;and mind was
winning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not you,&#8221; continued Lanagan pitilessly
as Martin lifted his haggard face with the look of
pleading of an animal in his eyes. &#8220;It was not
you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>But it was not she&mdash;not my mistress! It was</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
<i>me! Me!</i>&#8221; The last words were a shriek; but
the tax on his self-control had been too great. He
fainted.</p>

<p>They threw water on Martin then and forced
whiskey down his throat. He came to, staring in
confusion from one face to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have admitted the mother shot her own
child,&#8221; said Lanagan rapidly, giving Martin no opportunity
to recover his composure. &#8220;Now tell us
the circumstances of this unnatural crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martin&#8217;s breakdown was complete.</p>

<p>Elvira Hemingway, practically forced into an
engagement with Macondray largely through
propinquity&mdash;he was her brother&#8217;s partner and a
regular family guest&mdash;and through the wishes of
her mother, inordinately ambitious socially to ally
her daughter with the Macondrays, had finally jilted
Macondray for a struggling young doctor, Stanton,
a classmate at college. They were to have eloped,
so greatly did the girl dread the scene that she knew
would follow when her mother learned of her dismissal
of Macondray. Martin, loyal, as he had
said, to his mistress, but still more so to the daughter
of the house, was party to the elopement. He
had come to her room by prearrangement to help
her out with a grip or two in order that no suspicion
would attach should she be discovered in the
room, on the porch, or crossing the lawn. The machine&mdash;the
same that Macondray saw&mdash;was waiting
at the pepper tree. But while Martin was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the room the mother, on some slight errand, had unexpectedly
gone to her daughter&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>There she found her daughter fully attired, the
French window wide open, and caught a flashing
glimpse of a figure disappearing through the French
window, that she recognised as Martin. At first
flush she accepted the incident as an interrupted
rendezvous of some sort between her daughter and
her chauffeur, and one hot word of charge had
brought a swift retort from the daughter, and a
quarrel had arisen.</p>

<p>Martin, sneaking back to report progress in the
room to Stanton, heard the rising voices in anger,
and learned enough to know that the girl, under
stress of her excitement, had revealed the plan for
the elopement. He counselled with Stanton, and
both agreed that Stanton had best retire and await
developments, Martin to keep Stanton posted by
telephone. In the grief and excitement of the final
tragedy he did not do so, and the lover, worn by
a sleepless night, received his great blow when he
opened his morning paper. But this is not a tale
of love or lovers, except insofar as they concern
the solution of a crime, and Stanton therefore, with
his blighted life, passes out of the story.</p>

<p>Martin, determined to intercede in hope of softening
the lot of the daughter, taking all blame to himself
as the messenger of the secret lovers, hurried
then, back to the house.</p>

<p>Some primal strain of vulgarity, some poignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
pang of disappointed motherly ambitions, or possibly
some pang of personal ambitions thwarted,
led to the utterance of one malediction sharper than
all the others by the mother. In a moment of sudden
hysteria the old-fashioned revolver that had
been on her mantelpiece for years had been seized
by the daughter in a wild threat of suicide.</p>

<p>The mother seized her wrist. A violent physical
struggle for the weapon followed. This was occurring
just as Martin was making his way back
through the house to the room, taking along with
him the maid, Marie, huddled, frightened, against
the hall wall at sound of the unseemly family quarrel.</p>

<p>There was a flash and a report in his very eyes
as Martin opened the door. The revolver, he said,
was unmistakably in the mother&#8217;s hands; but
whether the discharge was accidental or intentional
in heat of passion, Martin could not say.</p>

<p>And that angle of the story never was cleared up.</p>

<p>The mother had swooned. When it was clear
to the frightened servants that the girl was dead,
they had carried the mother to her room.</p>

<p>The plan of the two was quickly formed. In
their clumsy way they concluded it would be
best for all concerned if the revolver should be
placed in the girl&#8217;s hand to indicate suicide. Martin
placed it there, while Marie laboured with
the hysterical mother, trying to instil in her mind,
in which the entire terrible scene was a whirl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the idea that Elvira had, in fact, committed suicide.</p>

<p>As for the confession:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel I was to blame in a way, sir,&#8221; concluded
Martin, wiping his eyes. &#8220;After all I would have
been a jailbird anyway if she hadn&#8217;t saved me, most
like. I thought I could protect her, too, sir, by confessing.
I supposed if I said I committed the murder
that would settle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan glanced at his watch. It was half-past
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one more move yet, Chief,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I go to press in thirty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment or two they had all reached the
Hemingway home again, surprised to find it brilliantly
lighted. Servants were running about
frantically. An excited voice was at the telephone
as the quartet walked through the door. It was the
butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry! Hurry!&#8221; he was crying. &#8220;Hemingway&#8217;s!
Pacific Avenue! For God&#8217;s sake hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carbolic, I think,&#8221; replied the butler. &#8220;She
escaped from the nurse and got to the bathroom.
She had been raving for an hour entirely out of
her head crying to Elvira to forgive her&mdash;that
she&mdash;&#8221; he stopped suddenly, his lips coming together
in a taut line. &#8220;Another loyal family retainer,&#8221;
thought Lanagan as he and the chief exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
quick glances. &#8220;Only this one can keep
his secret for all of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They hurried to render first aid, but one look convinced
the reporter and the policeman, used to
deaths in violent form, that the troubled and frightfully
burdened mother&#8217;s soul had gone to a higher
court for judgment.</p>

<p>Lanagan raced back downstairs for the telephone.
It was five minutes to two. By the accident of
being on the ground he would have at least that
tremendous exclusive of the mother&#8217;s suicide.</p>

<p>And that&mdash;good story as it was&mdash;was all the
<i>Enquirer</i> printed, for it was all that I finally got
from Lanagan just before the clock struck two.</p>

<p>Leslie, standing by the telephone, said, tentatively
and curiously, when the receiver was hung up:</p>

<p>&#8220;What about the real story? Saving that for
to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Chief,&#8221; drawled Lanagan, full brother in
the Fourth Estate. &#8220;No, Chief, that&#8217;s <i>all</i> the story.
She&#8217;s dead, isn&#8217;t she? They have had about
enough trouble, this family.&#8221;</p>

THE AMBASSADOR&#8217;S STICK-PIN</p>

THE AMBASSADOR&#8217;S STICK-PIN</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE manner of Lanagan&#8217;s acquiring the Ambassador&#8217;s
stick-pin is nearly, if not quite, as
interesting as the matter of his losing it. His possession
of the pin was simple enough when one understands
the chromatic ways of a police reporter&#8217;s
daily routine: and Jack Lanagan was the &#8220;star&#8221;
police reporter of the city. The surrender of the
pin is as easily understood, when one comes to learn
something of the devious paths the police reporter is
sometimes called on to follow, and the curious and
startling situations into which they sometimes lead.</p>

<p>Thus, when Lanagan, drifting indolently with
the matinée throngs down Powell street, stopped
to hold confab with &#8220;Kid&#8221; Monahan, that now retired
King of the pickpockets, it was natural enough
that he should remark on a stick-pin of odd design
that replaced the accustomed three-carat in the
&#8220;King&#8217;s&#8221; silk cravat. Gentry who lived by their
wits and other people&#8217;s wealth, affect stones of much
size. Some policemen wear them, too.</p>

<p>It was natural enough, that the &#8220;King,&#8221; proverbially
generous, noticing the glance of interest, should
say, &#8220;Here, wear it,&#8221; and with a motion as quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and as deft as a hummingbird&#8217;s flit, transfer the
pin from his tie to that of the newspaper man.</p>

<p>It was then for Lanagan to observe, dryly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your title is certainly earned,&#8221; as he extracted
the pin and offered it back. &#8220;But this being a pin
of very unusual design, I am afraid I might not be
able to wear it as gracefully while awaiting the possible
appearance of its owner, as can you. Further,
that little exhibition of refined &#8216;touch&#8217; you just
gave, excites some grave suspicions that you are
back at your old tricks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The one-time King knew Lanagan&#8217;s outspoken
ways. Further he knew perfectly that, while the
police accepted his declaration, since his last time
out, of fealty to the law, he was a two-timer. The
police were using him, or thought they were, as a
&#8220;stool;&#8221; Lanagan did not think so.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for what Lombroso classified
as the &#8216;criminal lobe,&#8217; I might really believe you
had reformed,&#8221; Lanagan had told him once. &#8220;But
in view of the lynx-like quality of your ears to be
all top and no bottom, I am afraid the stamp of an
extremely low moral resistance is indelibly upon
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Monahan had only grinned then as now, in
his ingenuous way, uncomprehending, and exalted
Lanagan a notch or two. For some minor favour
in times gone past, Lanagan had earned and held
steadfastly the King&#8217;s unswerving loyalty; not an
insignificant asset for a police reporter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said the King in pained sincerity, &#8220;I&#8217;m
not passing you no chance. Got it down at Small&#8217;s.
Was shoved for a finner and I took it out of curiosity.
Funny sticker, ain&#8217;t it? If anybody does
make you though, why of course, hand it over. I
like my old spark better anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Small, be it said, was probably the thriftiest and
crookedest fence inside the county, with the headquarters
men on the pawnbroker detail taking orders&mdash;and
percentages&mdash;from him, as faithfully
as they reported to their captain of detectives.
With another of those flits, the King placed back in
his own necktie his customary brilliant, taken from
his vest pocket. Before Lanagan could offer the
other pin back the second time, his companion had
left. Lanagan examined the pin critically.</p>

<p>It was a &#8220;funny sticker,&#8221; round, of gold and
the size and thickness of a quarter. The back was
plain, fitted with a patent clasp. On the face was
a delicate relief of two eagles, heads out. An eye,
a ruby for an iris, was in the exact centre. Below
the eye were two clasped hands and above, two
crossed swords. Woven around the entire design
was what he at first took to be a snake, but discovered,
on closer scrutiny, to be a rope. It was
a delicate and unusual product of the goldsmith&#8217;s
art.</p>

<p>Lanagan puzzled over it for an hour and then
concluded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Russian, from the eagles; emblem of a secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
order, evidently, from the eye; the clasped hands to
signify that an oath has been taken and the axe
or the rope is the headsman, or the hangman, for
a breach of faith. That sounds plausible. But
what particular society does it represent?&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed it in his tie and was recalling what he
had read about Russian secret societies, when he
was bumped violently by a short, swarthy individual
who had, unknown to him, been following. As
Lanagan straightened up he caught a quick flash,
as of a message of tacit understanding, in the
other&#8217;s eyes, as he gazed straight at the pin. In
another moment a black flat wallet, thin and oblong,
had been slipped adroitly into his inside coat pocket;
a word which sounded like &#8220;scoraya&#8221; had been
whispered in his ear, and the singular stranger had
departed to the street to jump aboard a passing
car, and disappear toward the ferry.</p>

<p>Lanagan made it a rule to be surprised at nothing,
to accept nothing as coincidence not proved so, and
to ignore no trifles. He was interested; highly interested,
and he wanted to know what &#8220;scoraya&#8221;
meant. That there was a connection between the
pin and the wallet was, to him, clear. Possibly
&#8220;scoraya&#8221; might help him.</p>

<p>In Fogarty&#8217;s back room, hard by police headquarters,
he found Petroff, Russian interpreter in the police
courts.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does a word that sounds like &#8216;scoraya&#8217;
mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>&#8220;It means &#8216;hurry,&#8217; &#8216;at once,&#8217; or any such meaning.
It is what you Americans say, &#8216;get a move
on,&#8217;&#8221; said Petroff.</p>

<p>Sitting apart Lanagan unfastened the black sealskin
wallet and drew out a single sheet of paper,
encased in a protection of oiled skin. There were
written on the paper in a bold, strong hand, an even
dozen words; words that sent his breath whistling
through his teeth. It was in English, plain, clear,
and signed by a name that gave even the imperturbable
Lanagan a mighty start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; mused Lanagan, &#8220;they either
have a system believed infallible, or they are mighty
reckless of State secrets&mdash;and they are not reckless.
Therefore the system has slipped a cog, and
I am the anointed bearer of the message of His
Serene Majesty, Nicholas. I appear to be on the
knees of the gods,&#8221; he went on, as he wandered the
streets, perplexed. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible, barely possible,
that I am tangled in some monumental hoax. But
I don&#8217;t believe it. If I don&#8217;t miss my guess I will
be giving the austere Mr. Sampson, damned of all
men of my tribe, the biggest exclusive his sweat-shop
paper has turned out in this generation. But&mdash;I
need more coincidences. I am plainly stumped.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had stopped by Lotta&#8217;s Fountain where the
traffic patrolman was endeavouring to untangle a
jam of trucks and automobiles.</p>

<p>Out of the very air, as though in wierd solution
to his perplexity, it came again:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>&#8220;Scoraya!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan wheeled to find the voice. He had
thought he must turn directly upon the man. There
was no one near him save the occupant of a
limousine, two feet away. The passenger was apparently
engrossed in the evening paper. The
window, though, was open. Lanagan watched him
covertly from the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! This is getting interesting. Here am
I, a live newspaper sprout, in the dead centre of a
bustling and work-a-day American city, caught as
sure as the sun shines, in the mysteries of a
diplomatic maze between two great nations, and
probably three, that is as twisted as a mediæval intrigue.
At this moment, the whereabouts of little
me and my message, are probably of as much importance
as the comings and goings of the Czar, the
Mikado, or the First Gentleman himself. But the
next gay cat that tries any scoraying on me, will get
the third degree right in Fogarty&#8217;s back room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The limousine, the traffic jam relieved, pulled
slowly ahead, but Lanagan could have sworn that
the benign gentleman within, just before it did,
turned fully upon him with a scrutiny of deliberate
coolness. It was a casual thing, such as might
have happened to anyone; but it appeared to Lanagan
that there was a look of secret understanding
in the other&#8217;s eyes, as they dropped twice to the
stick-pin and returned to Lanagan&#8217;s face, as though
in inquiry. Lanagan took the number of the car,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
89,776, and then returned to headquarters. He
wanted to see from the police register to whom
machine 89,776 belonged.</p>

<p>When he ran through the pages to the number,
the ragtime air he was whistling&mdash;very incorrectly&mdash;quickened
in tempo.</p>

<p>&#8220;89,776&mdash;owner&mdash;Boris Koshloff&mdash;2224
Pacific Avenue, San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha! Either I am hearing scorayas in my
mind, and either everybody that looks at me excites
my suspicions, or else the Russian Mr. Koshloff is
a link in the very plain chain that is stretching from
me and my pin to His Majesty Nicholas, at St.
Petersburg on one end, and the President in Washington
at the other. Frankly, it looks preposterous
that if Koshloff is on the job, he would use his own
machine. Then again&mdash;what if that is the method
chosen to point my path to me? If this message
is to anyone in San Francisco, they must know by
this time that it has gone astray. Barring my own
coincidence in bungling into State secrets via
&#8216;Kid&#8217; Monahan&#8217;s touch, and his taste for the
really distinctive in jewelry, it appears that everything
is working out on a very remarkable and
finished system. I shall pay Mr. Koshloff a visit.
He has been too much of a figure of mystery in this
city anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boris Koshloff, a wealthy Russian portrait
painter, had dropped into San Francisco with introductions,
some months before. He had earned a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
high repute for the elegance of the soirées given at
his house, and had figured in the public prints, moreover,
in other ways. On one occasion, a burglar,
found prowling within the Koshloff&#8217;s drawing
room, had been shot and killed by Koshloff, who
thereupon was lionised to a considerable extent by
the neurotic and sentimental elements of his circle.
He had figured again, when a household servant
had fallen from his second story window, receiving
frightful injuries. Although during his raving in
delirium the servant had cried frequently &#8220;spare
me! spare me!&#8221; and had led some cynical reporters
on the hospital beat to suspect foul play, nothing
was ever proved in face of Koshloff&#8217;s explanation
that the servant fell in cleaning windows. After
the man recovered sufficiently, he was removed by
Koshloff to a private hospital, and there he passed
from the scope of the newsgatherers and hence
from public attention.</p>

<p>Now, it might be well to say here, and before the
reader is too far carried away by the story, that the
curious chronicles of the happenings about to be
recorded must rest for all time, for their authentication,
in five quarters: the Russian government, the
American Department of State, Jack Lanagan,
&#8220;King&#8221; Monahan, and myself.</p>

<p>It is not probable that either the Russian or
American governments would affirm the truth of the
facts recorded. As for the rest&mdash;the extraordinary
series of complications following the receipts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the stick-pin, the use of such a device as the stick-pin,
as the connecting link in a grave international
crisis, the use of the personal courier rather than
cipher-code&mdash;they must all be accepted on my
word, the word of Lanagan, or the word of &#8220;King&#8221;
Monahan, who first received the pin. To such as
are unwilling to accept that proof, the story must
be read solely as a bit of fiction.</p>

<p>Lanagan strolled back to the <i>Enquirer</i>. I had
just finished several yards of real estate junk for
the business office, and was as grouchy as the
brother of the tribe always is, when assigned to do
business office write-ups.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine line for an able-bodied reporter,&#8221; said
Lanagan cynically, looking over my shoulder.
&#8220;Turn that rot in and come with me and be a real
reporter. I&#8217;ll give you a story that will make the
A. P. wires hum to the four corners of the earth&mdash;provided
my hunch don&#8217;t go altogether wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke to Sampson, telling him that there was
a bare chance of something turning up on the Russo-Japanese
situation, and asked for me to be detailed
to accompany him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; replied Sampson, &#8220;get after it. We
haven&#8217;t broken a story on that yet. The eastern
papers are having a lot of stuff on the Secretary of
State, though. He has dropped out of sight; the
A. P. is bringing in a story broken by the <i>Sun</i>,
that his supposed sickness was the bunk, and that
as a matter of fact he has been out of Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
for a week. Supposed to be in New York on some
confab with the Russian Ambassador who is at the
Waldorf-Astoria. The Ambassador denies any
such conference. It&#8217;s a hot yarn. Try to turn up
an end on it out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan suggested supper and as we lingered
over our coffee and cigars, he briefly outlined the
situation. I read the astounding message and must
confess that I was stirred to a very unprofessional
pitch of excitement. Before taking a car for
Pacific Avenue, we dropped in at police headquarters
where Lanagan met Chief Leslie, that shrewd
thief-taker, and they were in earnest talk for ten
minutes. In his police reporting Lanagan had the
superlative advantage of Leslie&#8217;s confidence. That
famous chief had indeed as high a regard for Lanagan&#8217;s
work as for that of his own men. Leslie
stood many a &#8220;roast&#8221; from the opposition papers
for his habit of programming with Lanagan, and
for turning over his men to the service of the newspaper
man more than once.</p>

<p>As we rode to our destination Lanagan instructed
me to take a position, well concealed, opposite the
Koshloff house, wait until midnight, and then if he
did not appear, telephone to headquarters where
Brady and Wilson, two of Leslie&#8217;s best men, would
be in readiness with the police automobile. We
were to force the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;For it&#8217;s just possible,&#8221; said Lanagan lightly,
&#8220;that I can&#8217;t escape delivering my packet. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
once drop to me, it may be interesting. That &#8216;burglar&#8217;
shot by Koshloff takes on rather a new importance.
Likewise that foreigner, who was all
broken up in an accidental fall from Koshloff&#8217;s
second story window. I rather look forward to a
run in with this gentleman of mystery and his retinue
of &#8216;scorayers.&#8217; But don&#8217;t wait after midnight.
Brady will have a search warrant on some
&#8217;phony charge or other, and you can tear right in.&#8221;</p>

<p>We parted company several blocks from the
Koshloff mansion. It was nearing nine-thirty. I
found a hiding-place almost directly opposite,
slipped in, and in a few moments saw Lanagan walk
briskly up the stairs of the Russian&#8217;s house. He
was whistling a bit of ragtime; as usual off key.
His insouciance cheered me. Frankly, I was nervous;
a weakness I cannot seem to overcome. I
have never failed Lanagan yet at a crisis, and I
suppose, on results, am as brave as he. But in my
own heart I know I am not. Possibly gifted with
a little more imagination than he, I can see further;
picture the slab at the morgue, the gang in the
police reporter&#8217;s room chipping in for a floral piece
while somebody tries to relieve the strain by saying
something funny; Johnny O&#8217;Grady or Jim Bradley,
or some of the others of the old guard delegated to
the pleasant detail of carrying the news home; it
was always the same. I always had that faculty,
as Hamlet says, of thinking too precisely on the
event.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>The door opened to Lanagan&#8217;s ring, and he
passed from my sight to be ushered along the main
hall, down a flight of steps, through another long
hall, carpeted richly, with niches here and there
holding exquisite statuary, to a billiard-room
panelled in richest mahogany. From the conduct
of his guide it was apparent that he was expected.
In the billiard-room two smooth-shaven, trim, keen-eyed
men were playing a desultory game. Surmise
was bulking large within Lanagan&#8217;s breast. He
had seen that same type before. Secret service was
stamped as indelibly upon them as his vocation is
stamped upon the upper office man.</p>

<p>A light tattoo on a panelling, an answering tattoo,
another staccato and the panel slid back and the
odour of black cigars was heavy on the air as Lanagan
stepped into a small compartment, the panel
slipping noiselessly shut behind him as his guide
disappeared. At a table were seated two men, facing
him.</p>

<p>One of the two he recognised: Koshloff. But
the other! Lanagan looked hard. There could be
no mistake; those features had been looming from
the front pages of the papers too frequently for any
mistake. Lanagan stood without speaking, but before
his mind&#8217;s eye was dancing the front page of
to-morrow&#8217;s <i>Enquirer</i>. He would lay a seven
column lead across that page that would carry
around the world.</p>

<p>It was Koshloff who spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>&#8220;You have the packet? Yes? Would you present
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, in a low voice to the other, as Lanagan
calmly placed the sealskin wallet upon the table,
Koshloff murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly my superiors must know their business.
But I cannot comprehend the disappearance
of Carlos and the transfer of the pin and packet to
the stranger. It must be in order, however. Our
system has never failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned a shrewd gaze upon Lanagan, studying
him intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you return?&#8221; he asked finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon as I am permitted to,&#8221; replied
Lanagan with perfect truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strange,&#8221; muttered Koshloff in the other&#8217;s ear.
&#8220;Peculiar. It is the answer. We have no choice.
It must be in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without more ado the packet was opened and
Koshloff presented the slip in silence to his companion.
That man, of massive, intellectual forehead
and deep set, penetrating eyes, scanned it carefully
and pondered long, Koshloff watching him
with half closed but eager eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell your Imperial Master,&#8221; said the other,
turning sharply upon Lanagan and speaking with
clean incisiveness, &#8220;that you met the Secretary of
State in person, and that the Secretary, speaking
for his excellency the President, says, that the answer
of the President is&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>The Secretary of State, ten days disappeared
from Washington, out here on the western fringe
of the continent, pledging the attitude of the United
States in the threatened Russo-Japanese conflict and
not a line in any paper in the world to indicate the
whereabouts of the Secretary, his business, or the
definite attitude of the United States in the impending
conflict!</p>

<p>It was the story of a newspaper man&#8217;s lifetime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry the verbal message, or transmit it to your
relief,&#8221; instructed Koshloff. &#8220;Conditions may not
make packets safe by the time you reach the Orient.
You may go. You have funds? Your pin is
safe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Lanagan, who, with two days to
go to pay day, had about sixty-five cents. He indicated
the pin with a gesture and turned on his
heel for the panel, to be stopped by a sudden muffled
uproar from the billiard-room, a sound of excited,
shrill cries, of scuffling.</p>

<p>Neither the Secretary nor Koshloff moved a muscle;
neither did Lanagan. He was thoroughly in
possession of himself. Two panels swiftly and
noiselessly slid open at the farther wall of the room,
and two smooth-shaven, trim, keen-eyed men stepped
into the room alertly and took their places beside
the Secretary&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Secretary travels with the entire secret service
bureau,&#8221; Lanagan found time to comment to
himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>There came a tattoo on the panel from the billiard-room.
The Secretary held up his hand for
silence and motioned one of the secret service
agents, who stepped noiselessly to the panel and
listened. The tapping came again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer,&#8221; commanded the Secretary. &#8220;It is
over, whatever it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>The panel slid open. Through the aperture came
one of the billiard players, flashing a quick, steely
glance upon Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Balked, by the eternal!&#8221; shot through Lanagan&#8217;s
mind. &#8220;The owner of that pin has shown up.
It&#8217;s now or never.&#8221; He stepped casually to the
panel; it was a fine chance. Once through there,
he could make a fight for the front door,&mdash;and the
seven column exclusive in the <i>Enquirer</i>.</p>

<p>Directly before him, fairly filling the space of the
panel, was the other billiard player. It was quick
action. Lanagan shot out his right for the man&#8217;s
jaw; but his arm got about half way. A grip like
an iron clamp had him just above the elbow. He
was whirled face about, a secret service man on
either side.</p>

<p>As though nothing had happened, the man
who had first entered through the panel door
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a person outside somewhat excited
who wishes to speak to Mr. Koshloff. He said to
say it was Carlos.&#8221;</p>

<p>Koshloff leaped for the doorway and in a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
more had dragged fairly by the hair of his head,
a wild-eyed, dark-visaged person who, when he
straightened up, perceived the pin in Lanagan&#8217;s tie
and made a tigerish spring for him, a dirk gleaming
in a half arc as he leaped. But the right fist of
one of the secret agents met him en route, and the
frenzied Carlos was disarmed. He staggered to his
feet, striving vainly to get at Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thief! Robber! Death to him! Death to him
who dares rob the messenger of His Imperial Majesty,
Nicholas!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman appears to be teething,&#8221; remarked
Lanagan.</p>

<p>Koshloff pressed a button and two swart giants
appeared. He indicated Carlos with a nod. &#8220;He
wore the pin, but he has failed in his obligation.
He must receive discipline.&#8221; The miserable wretch
fell to his knees with upraised hands, supplicating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no, Sire! My wife! My babies! Ten
minutes too late, or I would have had it back and
this sneak thief&#8217;s life!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Koshloff frowned impatiently and in a second
more Carlos was whisked away, a wierd scream
floating back wearily from some hidden corridor
to indicate the terror that gripped him. There
was something in that scream of fear of more than
the knout. As it rang through Lanagan&#8217;s ears,
he recalled the crossed axes and the hangman&#8217;s
noose of the pin. It was clear enough. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
would be another burglar killed. He wheeled upon
Koshloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Koshloff, or whoever or whatever
you are,&#8221; he said in a tone of deadly acidity, &#8220;that
man is turned up out of here unharmed by so much
as a scratch, or I&#8217;ll have you snaked into the city
prison within twenty-four hours, and some other
very general suspicions will incidentally be given
an airing. You may be the right eye or the right
hand of His Serene Majesty Nicholas, but I&#8217;m Jack
Lanagan of the San Francisco <i>Enquirer</i>, and in
my own particular bailiwick, something of a czar
myself. You&#8217;re a long way from Russia right
now. You&#8217;re in little old San Francisco. Did you
get me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The catlike quality of Lanagan&#8217;s eyes to glow
under the stress of anger or great excitement, exhibited
itself. His face in anger was not what was
calculated to put infants to slumber. He had forgotten
the Secretary for the moment; the agents had
all withdrawn. He was recalled to him when that
person, taking his cigar from his teeth and gazing
upon its ash contemplatively, said in even tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think possibly you are unduly exercising yourself.
Something of a Czar?&#8221; The smooth voice
went on. &#8220;Indeed, and it is a pleasure to meet
the Czar of the bailiwick of San Francisco,&#8221; and
the Secretary bowed profoundly and gravely.
&#8220;Now let us talk business, Mr. Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for Carlos, his case is absolutely ex-territorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
so far as we are concerned. Please inform
me how you came by that packet and pin&mdash;eavesdropping
in matters of State? Do you young men
of the press hold nothing sacred? Not your country&#8217;s
peace or the peace of other nations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as that goes,&#8221; retorted Lanagan, coolly,
&#8220;and not condescending to take note of your
&#8216;eavesdropping,&#8217; we young men of the press have
a duty to our papers which our papers in turn
owe to the people. In this case it is a clear duty.
By what right do you or any other man, president
or not, arrogate to yourself the power to hold this
secret caucus, resting your country&#8217;s stand in this
grave affair entirely upon the judgment of one or
two men? You are the servant of the people. Let
the whole people know where you are now and
what you are doing. Get the sentiment of your
country before you plunge into this agreement. I
personally most emphatically disagree with the answer
you are sending back. The public are as
likely to think my way as yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Secretary looked bored. &#8220;It is not possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With this exception,&#8221; grimly. Lanagan turned
for the panel and sought the spring. &#8220;It is ten
minutes after twelve,&#8221; he said laconically. &#8220;I
must leave here. Open the door, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither man moved. The Secretary said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not quite covered our ground. You
have not answered my question.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>&#8220;The pin I received from a friend who claimed
to have taken it from a pawnshop. The packet
was put in my pocket by a swarthy man who met
me on the street and who said &#8216;scoraya.&#8217; So did
another chap in Koshloff&#8217;s automobile. I wanted
to see the thing through that so accidentally came
my way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, when I came in here I did not come
alone. I am fully aware that nations, planning
wars to cost hundreds or thousands of lives, would
not scruple at one. My friends should be breaking
in here now. I told them to give me until
twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as your man Carlos is concerned, I can
only surmise that he was to meet a courier at the
steamer, but had his pin stolen from him. The
courier then wandered the streets seeking the pin,
and by happy chance tumbled against me wearing
it, and likewise wandering the streets. The other
&#8216;scoraya&#8217; boy I presume was one of Koshloff&#8217;s
secret service men, sent out to see that the messenger
reached here safely. He must have likewise
picked me up on the matinée promenade by
accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correctly reasoned,&#8221; murmured Koshloff.
&#8220;And I believe you have cleared the situation. A
most remarkable series of coincidences; but then,
anything may happen in this remarkable city of
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I go peaceably?&#8221; asked Lanagan, glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
at his watch. His voice hardened a trifle. It was
twelve-thirty.</p>

<p>&#8220;After&mdash;ah&mdash;a bit,&#8221; purred Koshloff, and the
next instant was gazing coolly into Lanagan&#8217;s police
Colt.</p>

<p>Koshloff lifted his hand with an indolent gesture,
to push the muzzle to one side, took a look
into Lanagan&#8217;s eyes, thought better of it, and turned
with mock deprecation to the Secretary. That gentleman
was watching Lanagan with frank admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a place for you, Mr. Lanagan,&#8221; he
said, heartily, &#8220;any time you care to come to Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan was nettled. Here were keen, quick-witted,
level-headed men poking quiet fun at his
spectacular display. Because they were of the quick
intuitions of the exceptional mind, they fathomed
his mind and knew that he would not shoot. Lanagan
felt rather boyish for a fleeting second; got himself
in perspective, as it were, and grinned at the
grotesqueness of the situation. Then that seven-column
scare head in the <i>Enquirer</i>&mdash;the exclusive
that was to hum around the world, focussed before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open that door!&#8221;</p>

<p>Koshloff arose then. There is something singularly
compelling about a blue-nosed revolver six
inches from your temple, regardless of any psychological
conviction you may have that the man is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
going to use it. But whether Lanagan would have
carried the situation through successfully cannot be
answered. For at that moment there came a tapping
on the panel. Koshloff stopped at a signal
from Lanagan. The tapping came again. The
Secretary spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;The situation is becoming strained, however
diverting it may be to all of us. For my part,
here are three men, all presumably of minds trained
to meet sudden exigencies, and yet no one of us can
solve this one. But other matters seem to be pressing.&#8221;
The tapping was becoming more insistent.
&#8220;Let us call a truce, Mr. Lanagan, of precisely ten
minutes. At the end of that time I give you my
word we will return matters to just their present
condition. It is agreeable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; said Lanagan, pocketing his revolver.</p>

<p>Koshloff sprang across the room and tapped.
He was answered to his satisfaction, for the panel
slid open, and after a whispered consultation with
one of the secret service men, Koshloff stood from
before the panel and&mdash;</p>

<p>I, Norton, my hands neatly manacled behind me,
was ushered into the room.</p>

<p>Never will I forget the look on Lanagan&#8217;s face.
For at least three seconds, he was jolted out of his
traditional immobility. His look was mingled
alarm, surprise and amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Norrie!&#8221; half-banteringly, half-serious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
&#8220;Poor old blunderbuss. I have certainly got him in
a fine mess, him and his sick wife at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was so glad to see that nothing had happened to
him, that I paid little attention to the other two for
the moment. I was telling him how I waited until
12:15 and had just determined on telephoning
headquarters for Brady and Wilson when, standing
as I supposed well concealed, I was suddenly pinioned
by two figures that seemed to start up from
the earth, handcuffed and hustled across the street
into the room where we now were.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must compliment you on your organisation,&#8221;
said Lanagan ironically, bowing toward Koshloff.
Around that gentleman&#8217;s bearded lips played the
faintest trace of a mocking smile. I could fancy
how that smile ground into the proud soul of Lanagan.</p>

<p>The Secretary was growing impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ten minutes, Mr. Lanagan?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>Lanagan turned and looked at me a long time.
&#8220;You should have obeyed orders,&#8221; he said finally.
&#8220;I told you to give me until twelve; not twelve-fifteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time in his life Lanagan had
ever criticised me, and it cut to the quick. I knew
then how bitter his disappointment was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your &#8216;proposition?&#8217;&#8221; he said, turning
abruptly to the Secretary, whom I had at once
recognised as well as Koshloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any &#8216;proposition,&#8217; Mr. Lanagan. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
is simply that neither the Russian government nor
our government can afford to let the world power
know that the Secretary of State journeyed, incognito,
across the American continent, to reach
a diplomatic agreement with Russia. Don&#8217;t you
realise what the publication of that unprecedented
thing would mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My only proposition is a declaration. You
hear most important information. It would undoubtedly
make a splendid news sensation to-morrow
morning. But you cannot possibly see the
great dangers you would involve your country in.
You might as well sit on a barrel of giant powder,
and drop your cigar and expect to save so much
as a collar button, as to print that story now and
avoid war.</p>

<p>&#8220;My being here was absolutely a matter imperative
for certain sufficient reasons. It was necessary
that I present myself to Mr. Koshloff in person.
That is all.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know newspaper men. Among the Washington
correspondents I number many warm
friends. I will take the judgment upon myself of
placing you both upon your honour. If I permit
you to go free from here, your lips are inviolately
sealed for all time, upon the contents of that telegram.
So far as I am concerned, that cannot be
used until such time as this trouble has been adjusted;
or, let me say, until the present administration
is out of power at Washington.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>Into the stillness that followed I could distinctly
hear Lanagan&#8217;s teeth grind together. Those remarkable
eyes of his seemed fairly to emit a stream
of fire, they blazed so fiercely upon Koshloff and
the Secretary. He threw a sweeping glance around
the room. It was a look for all the world like
you see in the eyes of a caged tiger when he is
aroused. For my part, there was a quick drop
some place under my diaphragm. I was thinking
of my sick wife, and the consequences to her of
being held a State&#8217;s prisoner.</p>

<p>His hand went to his pocket and he half drew
his revolver; but it was rather a subconscious act,
I think, than any deliberate design to use it. For
Government, after all, is a potent thing. We fight
for it and die for it. It has a splendid and natural
influence not to be lightly tossed from us. And
here sat one of Government&#8217;s highest representatives.
Lanagan&#8217;s hand dropped to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is better,&#8221; said the Secretary. &#8220;For
really, Mr. Lanagan, you cannot move from this
room until we say the word. You are as helpless
as though you were shackled. It is late and we
have important work to do. Your answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was almost pitiable to see Lanagan then. He
of a score of brilliant newspaper victories, the genius
of his craft, who found no situation too difficult
to solve, that striking figure in the newspaper life
of the West who knew no duty save to his paper,
who embodied the best and the highest ideals that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
tradition gives to the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate,
was beaten.</p>

<p>The glow had left his eyes and his voice was
dispirited, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my word, Mr. Secretary, but on one
condition: that Carlos&#8217; life be spared, and that you
start him back with your answer. It was no fault
of his. There is only one man in town who could
have got that pin from him, and I can hardly blame
Carlos for losing it, once Kid Monahan wanted it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That condition must be granted, Mr. Koshloff,&#8221;
said the Secretary. Koshloff hesitated. &#8220;The
wearer of the pin understands the penalty,&#8221; he
began, curtly. &#8220;I know. But in this case I personally
request it.&#8221; &#8220;It is granted,&#8221; said Koshloff,
definitely.</p>

<p>Lanagan was morose and savage. The Secretary
proffered cigars, which Lanagan impatiently
refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing that I would like, however,&#8221;
he said with but faint show of graciousness, &#8220;and
that is this pin. It will not be worn. I would like
it as a memento; as something tangible to exhibit
some day when I may tell this story, as proof, in
support of, possibly, one of the most unusual experiences
of myself or any other newspaper man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are but two in existence,&#8221; said Koshloff
soberly. &#8220;This one belongs to our Ambassador at
Washington. It was sent to me for use in receiving
the imperial message. The other&mdash;is in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
possession of the Czar, and will be worn by the receiving
courier at St. Petersburg. The penalty attaching
to the loss of the pin, either to myself or
my agents are&mdash;well, they are somewhat stringent
and, with the single exception of Carlos, have always
been enforced.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan snapped the patent clasp and handed the
pin to Koshloff.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, if I lost it,&#8221; with the slightest inflection
on the pronoun, &#8220;there would be no Czar of
this &#8216;particular bailiwick&#8217; to pardon me as you
pardoned Carlos, Mr. Koshloff.&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked the long distance back to town and
dropped in at &mdash;&mdash;. Lanagan had not addressed
a word to me. I knew better than to attempt
to draw him into conversation. I could feel
that he was working the thing over and over again
in his mind. He suddenly burst forth passionately:</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have beaten them! I could have beaten
them! And they didn&#8217;t convince me at that, that
the story should not have been printed! There&#8217;s
too much of this one-man-for-the-nation stuff in
our government, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was months before Lanagan told me that it
was because of my wife&#8217;s feeble health that he
feared to take the risk of having us both bottled
up for a month, by man&oelig;uvring further for freedom;
and had added: &#8220;Merely another argument
to prove that your true reporter should not marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as if to justify the truth of Lanagan&#8217;s assertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to me that the story should have been printed,
within three days the Japanese fleet, scorpion-like,
had struck and crippled that unsuspecting and unready
Russian flotilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah!&#8221; Lanagan had cried to me in furious
disgust, as he ripped the front page of the <i>Enquirer</i>
with its seven-column war head to tatters, &#8220;Statesmen!
Diplomats! Give me one live reporter, and
I&#8217;ll teach the whole gang of them the right way!
Do you suppose for one single, solitary, coruscating
second, that if those Japs knew the Secretary
was hobnobbing with the Russian envoy right here
in San Francisco, that the blow would have been
struck? Well, I tell you No! I wouldn&#8217;t even
have had to print the message. The story of the
meeting was enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, the time limit set by the Secretary has long
since expired, so here is the suppressed story of the
Ambassador&#8217;s Stick-Pin, the finest, biggest, cleanest
in its elements of any of his whole career, as
Lanagan mourned to me more than once.</p>

WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SAMPSON, city editor of the San Francisco <i>Enquirer</i>,
sat scowling over the <i>Times</i> and the
<i>Herald</i>. Stripped blackly across the front pages
of those rival morning papers was the unaccustomed
seven-column head:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">SUSPECT JAILED FOR MONTEAGLE MURDER!</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Norton!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Sampson&#8217;s voice. When Sampson shot
that curt call in his ugly voice through the swinging
doors of his office I felt as though the warden
was calling me from the condemned cell for the
drop. Only the able-bodied newspaper man who
has been trimmed hard by the men of the opposition
papers can understand the sensation. It belongs
in its exquisite misery solely to such as speak
the language of the tribe. For the head in the
<i>Enquirer</i>&mdash;my story&mdash;had been only a three-column:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">POLICE ARE BAFFLED IN MONTEAGLE MYSTERY!</p></blockquote>

<p>Sampson contemplated me coldly and long; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
fairly brooded over me. But there was no outburst,
and that, after all, hurt worse than if he had
put me on the irons for a broiling.</p>

<p>Ralph Monteagle, broker, millionaire, well-known,
popular, and engaged to the equally well-known
and popular Helen Dennison, had been
found in his office on the fourth floor of the Sutton
Building, stabbed to death. No weapon was
found, the door was locked, the window shut.
Neither money nor valuables were taken. The
knife, curiously, had been sliced once across each
cheek, evidently done after death, with deliberate
intent to mar the features. Monteagle had entered
his offices at 9:15 o&#8217;clock on Monday evening. The
watchman had discovered the crime at midnight.
The system in the Sutton Building permitted an
absolute check on all persons entering the building
after 8 o&#8217;clock, when the outer doors were locked.
Any person coming in after that hour was admitted
by the watchman, Murray, who until 12 o&#8217;clock was
stationed in the lobby. The night elevator man
kept a record of each person entering the building
and to which room he went. It was a building
given over to brokers, capitalists, and large law
firms, and several robberies of magnitude had
brought about this particular system of keeping a
check on all persons in the building after night.</p>

<p>The elevator man, on going off duty at midnight,
turned his book over to the watchman, who thereupon
made the rounds of each of the offices where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
there were still tenants or visitors. It was in this
manner that the crime had been discovered after
Murray had rapped repeatedly on Monteagle&#8217;s door
and had finally admitted himself with his master&#8217;s
key.</p>

<p>Only three other tenants had been in the building
during the evening, and they were able to clear
themselves of all suspicion. The police turned their
attention to the attachés of the building. Suspicion
fell on a janitor, Stromberg, who had the
fourth and fifth floors. Apparently clinching proof
of the police suspicions had been afforded when
Stromberg&#8217;s jumper, blood stained, was located at
his laundry. It was in the arrest of Stromberg,
which had taken place late the night before, that I
had been &#8220;scooped&#8221; through my zealousness in
leaving the detectives uncovered while I followed
a lead that subsequently proved entirely wrong.</p>

<p>Stromberg claimed to have cut his hand with a
scraper while cleaning the mosaic tiling, and had a
deep gash on the ball of his thumb. The police
theory was that he had gashed himself purposely,
and in answer to his defence that it would have
been an insane thing for him to have sent his jumper
to the laundry if he had committed the crime,
held to the theory that he had taken precisely that
method, in combination with the self-imposed gash
on his hand, to divert suspicion by seeming frankness.</p>

<p>With the commendable faculty of the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
police in usually working to fasten the crime upon
whomsoever they may happen to have in custody,
the officers were devoting their energies to &#8220;cinching&#8221;
their case on Stromberg.</p>

<p>When Sampson had completed his disquieting survey
of me, he finally said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am giving this story to Ransom and Dickson
to handle to-day.&#8221; I could see that he had it all
figured out in his cold-blooded way; that nothing
else was to be expected of me than to be scooped,
and that any remarks would be superfluous. But
it ground me. &#8220;What I want you to do,&#8221; he continued
nastily, &#8220;is to find Lanagan. Possibly you
can succeed in that at least. I wouldn&#8217;t be sorry at
that if some more of you fellows drank the brand of
liquor Lanagan drinks once in a while. I might
get a story out of the bunch of you occasionally.
Instead, the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Herald</i> give it to us on
the features of this story three days running&mdash;<i>three
days</i>. It&#8217;s the worst beating I&#8217;ve had in a
year. You find Lanagan and tell him I want him
to jump into the story independent of Ransom and
Dickson. I would like to get the tail feathers out
of this thing, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ransom and Dickson had no relish for the story,
three days old.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might as well try to galvanise a corpse,&#8221; grumbled
Ransom. I turned over to them what matters
I had that might bear watching, and was about to
leave the office when the &#8217;phone rang for me. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
fortunately, it was Lanagan; and I couldn&#8217;t forbear
a sort of gulp, because I felt instinctively that he
had wakened up somewhere out of his ten days&#8217;
lapse, with the knowledge that I was handling the
Monteagle story and was getting badly beaten on it.
I was right in that, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I would catch you before you left,&#8221;
he said. His voice was throaty, and I judged that
he had been seeing some hard days and nights.
&#8220;Suppose that pickled jellyfish of a Sampson has
been lacing you? You should be laced. Met
Brady a few minutes ago and he said you were
handling&mdash;or mishandling&mdash;the story. You
ought to get a month&#8217;s lay-off for letting that
crowd of two-by-four dubs, on the <i>Times</i> at least,
get the best of you. Come on down. I want to
talk things over.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was at Billy Connors&#8217; &#8220;Buckets of Blood,&#8221;
that famed barroom rendezvous by the Hall of
Justice, where the thieves&#8217; clans were wont to forgather.
There was nothing of particular coincidence
in his ringing me up just when he did; it was
shortly after 1 o&#8217;clock, the hour when the local staff
reported on, and he would be sure of finding me in.</p>

<p>He sat at the rear alcove table with &#8220;King&#8221; Monahan.
&#8220;You know my friend the King, of
course?&#8221; was his greeting. Monahan, one-time
designated King of the Pick-pockets, after serving
two terms, had retired from the active practice of
that profession to establish himself, it was generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
believed, not only as a &#8220;fence,&#8221; handling exclusively
the precious stones, but also as a sort of
local organiser, to whom any outside gang must
report on or before beginning operations in San
Francisco. There is system in crime these days
as in all things else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind of stuck it in and broke it off, didn&#8217;t
they?&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve stood one panning from Sampson; I don&#8217;t
want another from you,&#8221; I retorted savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Norrie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you overlooked a very vital
point. The King and I have been talking it over,&#8221;&mdash;he
had the three morning papers spread out before
him&mdash;&#8220;and we have concluded that there was
a woman in the case. And when two eminent criminologists,
like Kid Monahan and Jack Lanagan,
agree that there is a woman in a case, it at least is
worthy of consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A moll, sure,&#8221; vouchsafed Monahan in his diffident
way. He had a manner as timorous as a
girl, which possibly accounted for the success that
he enjoyed while practising his profession. He was
not one, on the crowded platform of a trolley car,
who would be immediately suspected when some
proletarian raised a cry of sneak thief and sought
in vain for a stick pin, watch, or wallet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stromberg may or may not be guilty,&#8221; said
Lanagan, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think much of the case the
police have made against him. It, at least, doesn&#8217;t
bar us from another line of speculation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>&#8220;Tell me, for instance, why in the name of the
Seven Suns, didn&#8217;t some of you sleuths go off on
the theory that whoever committed that crime got
into the office earlier in the evening and remained
concealed in the closet until Monteagle came in?
It would have been the easiest thing in the world
to have decoyed Monteagle to his office even if it
wasn&#8217;t known that he was working nights to make
up for the lunches and bachelor dinners and afternoon
teas that he&#8217;s been going to on account of his
coming marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as for whoever committed the murder getting
out, you have been on the scene of too many
murders not to know the hysteria that comes over
a bunch of yaps like that. It&#8217;s a safe bet they all
ran for a regular policeman, and that whoever was
in that room&mdash;provided he was still there, or she&mdash;when
the crime was discovered could have
walked out of that building with a fair way as wide
as Market Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Murray ran for a policeman,&#8221; I admitted, &#8220;and
some of the janitors with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what special cops usually do,&#8221; was Lanagan&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a safe bet that those
square-head janitors all ran with him. They didn&#8217;t
stay around those corridors alone after that crime
was discovered until a regular copper came along.
I&#8217;ve seen the thing happen and so has every police
reporter in the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan paused, pushed back a half-drained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
suisses and called for a sweet soda&mdash;his curious
habit when breaking off a &#8220;lapse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever killed Monteagle,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;was in that room when he entered&mdash;always assuming,
of course, that it was not Stromberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I have something additional, through the
King and his invaluable sources of information on
men and affairs. It is this: Monteagle is known to
certain portions of the night life. He was a two-faced
society blatherskite, with a broad streak of
primal vulgarity, who drank tea in swagger drawing-rooms
with his fiancée and her friends in the
afternoon and champagne with an entirely different
social set after midnight. You know the kind.
Was rather keen about women in an underhanded,
quiet way. It is not difficult for a man of his means
to do a lot of things behind the unassailable French
restaurant walls and get by with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You recall the knife was drawn neatly across
both cheeks. I see you indulged in a theory that
he possibly was the victim of some blackmail brotherhood.
You even hinted at the Mafia. I am surprised
at you. You ought to let that exaggerated
institution rest for a while. I have a little theory
of my own on that knifing business, which, I think,
we will now work upon. &#8217;Phone Sampson when
you get a chance that it pleases Lanagan to go to
work for his sweat-shop wages again.&#8221;</p>

<p>We parted company with Monahan after he had
promised Lanagan to drift through his particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
world&mdash;or that portion of it which was then up&mdash;and
endeavour to learn something of the identity
of any of Monteagle&#8217;s affiliations under the rose.</p>

<p>We headed for the Sutton Building, and in the
lobby found Murray, just coming on duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think anyone could have gotten out of
that room in the excitement after you found the
body?&#8221; asked Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Murray, with aged preciseness.
&#8220;I locked the door on the outside when I went for
an officer, and it could not have been opened, because
in my hurry I left my master&#8217;s key turned in
the lock when I went for a policeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>So much for Lanagan&#8217;s very plausible theory of
the &#8220;get-away.&#8221; He came up from it as suave as
ever and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Could anyone have been in that room before
Monteagle came in, do you suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Murray, with the didacticism of
the aged again. &#8220;No, sir. There was nobody in
that room. I know because the elevator boy, Denny,
heard the telephone bell ringing for eight or ten
times, and finally let himself in and answered it,
but the party hung up. Mr. Monteagle was very
free and easy with us men, which accounts for
Denny taking the liberty. There was nobody in
that room when Denny was in there, and that was
well after eight o&#8217;clock, after I came on duty. It
all gets me, sir, how that knife sticker got into that
room or how he got out after he got there. I don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
like to think Ole Stromberg had a hand in it, but
it looks a leetle black for Ole, according to the papers.
I know my skirts are clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went on up to the room. The Public Administrator,
with Monteagle&#8217;s lawyer and his stenographer,
was there. The lawyer was inclined to
get forward, but the Administrator was a good programer
for a newspaper man and smoothed matters
over. Lanagan was studying the stenographer:
intelligent of feature, stylishly but plainly dressed,
and bearing about her eyes and mouth very plain
indications of the nervous tension under which she
must have laboured during the last three days. She
was one of that type of well-poised secretary-stenographers
found in most large offices.</p>

<p>Lanagan made an opportunity of asking her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Monteagle have any enemies that you
know of? Persons who have threatened him personally,
by letter or over the &#8217;phone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None that I know of,&#8221; she replied quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; asked Lanagan quickly, eying
the girl narrowly with those singularly penetrating
eyes of his, &#8220;do you think it could have been possible
that a person might have been concealed in that
closet when you locked the office door for the
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no,&#8221; she answered quickly, but her eyes
involuntarily swept first to the closet and then to
Lanagan&#8217;s face as though in secret, anxious questioning.
&#8220;Why, it makes me shiver even to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
such a thing could have happened,&#8221; she added, and
she unmistakably shivered a little.</p>

<p>There was more conversation, and Lanagan fell
to examining the room. He first examined the
closet. Then he opened the window and scrutinised
the sill for a long time. He got down on his
knees and peered beneath the heat radiator of coiled
pipes. He lit a match, the space between the bottom
of the radiator and the floor being so slight
that he could not examine it as closely as he seemed
to want to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Expect your man to get into the room through
that?&#8221; asked the Public Administrator with heavy
facetiousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied Lanagan smoothly; &#8220;it&#8217;s just
possible he got out of the room through it, though,&#8221;
and continued with his minute examination.</p>

<p>The stenographer, Grace Northrup by name, although
assisting the other two sorting out papers,
found time each moment to flash a quick glance at
Lanagan. Whether it was merely active feminine
curiosity I could not determine. As for me, I had
been over the room half a dozen times already.
It held nothing further for me; but I never could
even guess at the clues Lanagan might turn up on
a trail that a dozen men had tramped over, so I remained
to see him work with keen interest. When
Lanagan had finished we left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Norrie, my boy, to the Bush Street office
of the telephone company,&#8221; he said with as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
enthusiasm as I ever saw him exhibit. &#8220;You are
a fine old blunderbuss for fair! But the others
aren&#8217;t any better. Plain as the nose on your face!
Lord, Lord!&#8221; He stopped and looked at me,
laughing immoderately. I was inclined to be a
trifle sulky; he made me feel like a six-dollar cub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;it&#8217;s a three days&#8217; trail
that I have taken up, and that dirk wielder has got
just that much of a start&mdash;always assuming, for
the sake of the argument, that it was not Stromberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t ask him what he was going to the telephone
office for; it came to me with a sting that I
had heard that same bit of information about the
telephoning dropped during the last two or three
days, and, in the press of clues that I considered
more important, had dismissed it. Which was the
difference between Jack Lanagan and the rest of us;
he had that intuitive faculty of eliminating the superfluous
and driving at the main fact. It is, after
all, a faculty found in all successful men of whatever
occupation.</p>

<p>We both knew Lamb, traffic manager of the
&#8217;phone company. Lanagan asked for permission
to talk with the girl who on Monday night handled
the board having Bush 1243&mdash;Monteagle&#8217;s number.
Lamb was a substantial chap, and promised
to keep our visit in confidence. It was just before
4 o&#8217;clock, and the 4 to 10 shift of girls was coming
on. In a few moments a young girl of sensible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
pleasant demeanour was shown to the room, and
Lamb retired after requesting that she give us all
the information she might have on whatever subjects
we discussed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be performing a service that will be
appreciated,&#8221; said Lanagan, &#8220;if you could recall
whether on Monday evening, along about 8 o&#8217;clock,
you had several calls for Bush 1243?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I do,&#8221; she instantly answered. &#8220;It
was not a busy night and I was handling three positions.
The call came from the east office. We
do not talk to the party direct on an outside call,
and east supervisor came on the line several times
to instruct me to try and raise the number. That
is how I recall it so distinctly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may tell you that that is the telephone number
of the office of Mr. Monteagle, who was murdered,&#8221;
said Lanagan. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you ever got a
line on whom his telephone calls might be from as
a general thing, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; she answered primly. &#8220;I pay no attention
to whom is on a line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Lanagan. &#8220;I think you can
be trusted not to say anything about our visit or
questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>We got a card of introduction from Lamb to
Adams, manager of east office, and hurried there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that rather an indiscreet thing to do,
tell her Monteagle&#8217;s number?&#8221; I suggested. Lanagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
laughed and slapped me on the back. It was
evident he was in high feather with himself. I
was trundling along, absolutely in the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Norrie, when you meet a girl like that
take her into your confidence. Did you get that
&#8216;to whom&#8217;? She smelt a rat and would have
looked the number up and blown the glad tidings
all over the office that a couple of detectives or
newspaper men had been interviewing her on the
murder. Recollect, too, that the telephone from
the reporters&#8217; room at police headquarters comes
in on this exchange. It&#8217;s just possible that some
of those gay young blades on night police have affiliations
with some of these gay young blondes. I
have got many a story through &#8217;phone girls&mdash;and
have occasionally lost a story through the same medium.
Get me? As it stands, she is all puffed up
with her own importance and pat with us. There
are times when you have got to take a chance at
spilling your hand. This was one of them.&#8221; I
subsided, humbled.</p>

<p>Not to occupy too much space with the merely
routine details of working out the clue, we met
Adams, another substantial chap. The chief operator
recalled distinctly the number, more particularly
because the woman calling it had been nervous
and irritable. The call came, she said, from the
public booth at Shumate&#8217;s pharmacy. It was only
a couple of blocks away, and we went there.</p>

<p>It was a large establishment with half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
clerks. We worked down the list. The fourth
man had been on duty Monday night and recalled
a young woman who had entered the booth repeatedly
on that evening. She lived some place in the
vicinity, he said, and usually got off the Sutter
Street car shortly after 5.30 o&#8217;clock. The car
stopped directly in front of the door, and if we
would wait he would point her out to us if she
came that way this evening.</p>

<p>I took a position outside to signal in when a car
approached and Lanagan remained inside. It was
then just after five.</p>

<p>Among the passengers from one car I noticed
Miss Northrup, and was about to step forward and
speak to her on a chance of her dropping something
additional when I caught a glimpse out of the tail
of my eye of Lanagan signaling me with a swift
gesture. I dodged around the corner before she
saw me. She passed on up Sutter Street, and in a
few moments Lanagan picked me up, his sallow
face taking on a tinge of colour and his dark eyes
sparkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty near scrambled the eggs that time, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;<i>That&#8217;s the woman who did
the telephoning.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you recall that furtive look with which
she followed me at the office? She lives just up
there, where we will let her rest for a time with
her troubles. And I fancy she has them. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
go back to Connors&#8217;. I am to meet Monahan
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King was waiting for us. He took Lanagan
to one side. All I could hear was Lanagan&#8217;s
&#8220;Good!&#8221; once, and then the King had slipped out
the side door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Best single asset the police have is Monahan,&#8221;
said Lanagan, apropos of nothing in particular.
&#8220;Knows more about the night life of this city than
any four men in it. But he tips nothing that might
hurt his own game or his own people. In a way
he preserves a certain code even while acting as a
police &#8216;stool.&#8217; In this matter, however, the invaluable
Mr. Monahan is working for Jack Lanagan;
and the police are consequently about three
laps behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see nothing in sight for some hours. We
will eat our dinner and take in a show for a few
moments. I rather anticipate a climax later and
some rapid-fire work for us both on the typewriter.
I need a little stimulus&mdash;that hasn&#8217;t got wormwood
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would give me absolutely not a line on his
&#8220;lay.&#8221; He could be a baffling, enigmatic, impersonal
proposition when he took the humour.</p>

<p>We headed for the Oyster Loaf, and I groaned
for the four and a half that was between me and
pay day as Lanagan methodically disposed of an
onion soup, special; French mushrooms on toast,
a New York cut, Gorgonzola, and a two-bit cigar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
He drank three glasses of ice water, but that didn&#8217;t
cost anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s meal,&#8221; he said with vast creature content.
&#8220;Now give me that other half you have
left. I want a shave. You go up and touch Dan
for a five-spot. We may need expenses later. I&#8217;ll
meet you at Dan&#8217;s at nine o&#8217;clock. I want to pick
Monahan up again before I see you, and also see
Leslie.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the time appointed we met. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a
ten-twenty-thirty,&#8221; suggested Lanagan. &#8220;By half-past
ten we will have to get busy. There&#8217;s a singer
over at the Continental that some of the dramatic
critics say has real fire. La Pattini, I think she is
called.&#8221;</p>

<p>So we drifted into the Continental and caught
part of the performance. There were trained birds
of more than ordinary sagacity; the stereotyped
and fearful cornet soloist; the girl singer, La Pattini,
with a wonderful mezzo, remarkable beauty,
an undoubted future, and an ability to sing the
&#8220;Rosary&#8221; in a manner to bring tears. Then came
a slap-stick tumbling act that was impossible, and
we left.</p>

<p>Lanagan had suddenly become thoughtful. &#8220;Do
you know what I think?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think the
world would actually do better to sweep away every
vestige of law and ordinance and make a clean start
again. Our system of punishment is all wrong.
Take one heinous class of crimes; we punish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
individual who takes upon herself to punish. We
say the State has the power of punishment and the
prerogative; and yet in the very crimes that are the
most damnable, the State can never interfere because
the injured party must suffer in silence. You
might as well expect children to learn English
through hieroglyphics as to make applicable to present-day
conditions the antiquated penal code to
which society is harnessed. That&#8217;s about enough
of the sermon stuff. It&#8217;s not in my line.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan was taking the lead, but I was not altogether
surprised when we finally found ourselves
in the neighbourhood of the Northrup home. Nor
was I altogether surprised when Chief Leslie, that
shrewd and veteran thief-taker, suddenly stepped
from a doorway. My mind shot ahead to the
Northrup home, a few doors away, and I could not
bring myself to believe it could be possible that
she was a principal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brady is above,&#8221; said Leslie. &#8220;He says she
came in about twenty minutes ago. We had better
move on her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately,&#8221; said Lanagan, and in a moment
more we were all three before the door to a lower
flat of the old-fashioned sort, with a bell jangling
noisily as Lanagan pulled out the handle.</p>

<p>It was Miss Northrup who answered the ring.
She had on a dressing gown, and her hair, I could
see, had been taken down for retiring and then
gathered in a loose coil on her head, probably when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the bell rang. She opened the door but a few
inches.</p>

<p>&#8220;We would like to speak with you a moment,
Miss Northrup,&#8221; said Lanagan. He indicated the
chief. &#8220;This is Chief Leslie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kindly permit us to enter,&#8221; said the chief.
There was a shadow of authority in his tone, and
I knew that Lanagan and the chief were planning
a drive on the girl and that something would be
stirring in this old-fashioned flat before long. She
hesitated a moment and then threw the door wide
open and motioned us into the parlour. In the hall
a gas jet burned dimly, as though for some member
of the family who was not yet home.</p>

<p>She reached up and turned on the parlour light,
and as she did so her loosely coiled hair tumbled
about her shoulders. As the light struck down
upon her features they had an appearance almost
tragic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be seated,&#8221; she said; it needed no expert eye
to detect in her drawn lips the evidence of nervous
tension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Leslie abruptly, snapping his
jaws like a trap&mdash;and I knew this twenty-year-old
girl was in for the third degree&mdash;&#8220;unless you at
this time make a clean breast of all that you know
concerning the murder of your employer, Ralph
Monteagle, it will be necessary for me to book you
for murder as an accessory before the fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started violently; her bosom began to rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and fall quickly; it was evident a breakdown was
imminent, but she managed to say with considerable
smoothness:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing more than I have already told
the police and the reporters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan, fierce eagerness glittering in his eyes,
stepped before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, possibly you know,&#8221; he said, biting
each word off short, &#8220;how many persons beside
yourself and Bartlett, Monteagle&#8217;s former chauffeur,
who bought it, knew of the rope in his closet;
knew that Monteagle had a morbid fear of being
trapped in that building at night by fire; that he
had had that fear since his friend Mervin was
burned to death in the Baldwin Hotel fire; that he
let no one know about the rope for fear of being
ridiculed? How many persons, I say, besides yourself
and Bartlett, knew the rope was there? <i>And
when you knew that that rope had disappeared, as
you must have known it, why didn&#8217;t you tell the
police? Why did you permit a man to lie in prison
whom you in your heart feel is innocent?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and threw both hands
towards him as though warding off physical blows.
She was trembling in intense agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t! for God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank back again into her chair, her face buried
in her hands, rocking and moaning, with Lanagan
standing over her, inexorable as Nemesis.</p>

<p>There was the sound of quick, light running up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the front stairs, a key was turned in the lock, the
front door swung open, and the girl in the chair,
startled from her huddled misery, sprang to her
feet and fairly leaped to meet the newcomer. She
cried out, but whether in warning or in the joy of
greeting could not be said, for her voice was half-smothered
in a sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister!&#8221; she said at last falteringly. &#8220;Sister,
please go to your room. It is only some more policemen
about Mr. Monteagle!&#8221; The words came
chokingly. The other had not as yet come into our
sight, but now she stepped into the light that
streamed from the parlour into the hall&mdash;and I
heard Lanagan&#8217;s swift, involuntary ejaculation:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>La Pattini! Her sister!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie, swift as thought, was half-across the parlour
floor to the hall, yielding to a natural police impulse,
but the newcomer, the other girl clinging to
her, stepped fully into the doorway to the parlour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said in a voice that had no tremour of
emotion, &#8220;La Pattini. Her sister. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Leslie, grimly. &#8220;Because we
were just going to book her for murder as an accessory
before the fact. We will switch the cut
now and book you as the principal.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the feet of the queenly Pattini the harassed
sister swooned. Lanagan pulled shut the door
leading to the hall so that no one might by any
mischance disturb us, and I fell to chafing the
wrists of the senseless girl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>La Pattini sank wearily to a chair, stooping so
that she could stroke her sister&#8217;s temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad it is over,&#8221; she said, apathetically.
&#8220;I have only wondered that it did not come sooner.
I have expected it hourly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The story was soon told: simple, age-old, but
ever new, sordid possibly to a slight degree, but
profoundly sad. She who was now known as La
Pattini met Monteagle while visiting her sister at
his office. He had found means to extend the acquaintance,
had aided her in a secret way in her
ambitions for the stage, securing the engagement
at the Continental for her, and as a result of the
clandestine relation there had been a promise of
marriage. Then had come the engagement announcement
of the Dennison-Monteagle marriage
and the awakening of the dupe. But this was not
the dupe of Monteagle&#8217;s many experiences. The
picture of Miss Dennison, staring at her from the
society columns, had fired a sinister jealousy.</p>

<p>A confession had been made to the younger sister
when La Pattini sought an opportunity of pleading
once again alone with Monteagle, who had
finally repudiated her. The sister had admitted
her to the office after Monteagle left for the afternoon,
knowing he was to return in the evening.
She concealed herself in the closet.</p>

<p>Before she entered the office her plan had been
formed. Either Monteagle would marry her or he
should die. At that time she had no thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
escaping. She had heard the telephone ringing repeatedly;
heard the elevator boy enter the room
just too late to get the party calling.</p>

<p>Finally Monteagle had arrived and she had discovered
herself. What happened was quickly
over. The quarrel was of few words, and he had
struck her with his fist. She stabbed him to the
heart, and then with a vindictiveness that she could
not now understand and shuddered at recalling had
marred his features with the knife. Her first
thought had been to give herself up. Then she
wondered why she should do that. The brief
words of their quarrel had not been heard; the
janitor she could hear on the floor above. After
all, she had done no more than kill a snake.</p>

<p>The thought of the rope came to her. She knew
about it, because once when she was in the office
as Monteagle worked late she had expressed
anxiety at being seen coming from the building
with him, and he had showed her the rope and
jokingly offered to let her down from the window,
which opened upon a divisional alley in the rear
of the Sutton building.</p>

<p>The rope was of great length. Seeking for a
place to tie it, she naturally turned to the radiator.
The thought occurred to her with a flash her means
of escape from the room might never be known
if the rope was long enough to run under the radiator,
letting both ends to the ground. She could
then draw it down after she reached the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
by pulling on one end and letting it run under the
radiator like a pulley. She tried the length, the
light from the windows of the elevator shaft, opening
into the areaway, giving sufficient brightness.</p>

<p>&#8220;As part of the preparation for the future on
the stage that Mr. Monteagle was to help me get,&#8221;
she said, dispassionately, &#8220;I have taken gymnasium
work to build up my system. You can see it
was no extraordinary thing for me to let myself
down by the double rope, pulling the window shut
after I climbed out. I left it open enough so that
the rope could run free when I pulled it after me.
I threw the rope in a street garbage tin. I was
at the theatre, remarkable as it may seem, in time
for my act at ten o&#8217;clock, although I missed the
first show. I have been in a daze since; I was in
a trance after I did the stabbing. I have known
I must be found out. I am glad that it is all over.
I have made no attempt to escape. I am absolutely
indifferent to my fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sister, recovered from her swoon, was weeping
softly, her head bowed in the other&#8217;s lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said Lanagan curiously to her,
&#8220;why did you telephone to Monteagle?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gasped, and it appeared for the moment that
she was about to swoon again. Finally she faltered,
while her own sister looked at her strangely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;was afraid sister meant him harm&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
didn&#8217;t think of it until I got home&mdash;and then
something about her face came back to me&mdash;I
wanted to warn Mr. Monteagle not to arouse her&mdash;I
finally succeeded in getting him at his club
before he left for his office and&mdash;he only
laughed&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said La Pattini bitterly, &#8220;he told me
so&mdash;and laughed&mdash;and snapped his fingers when
he spoke about you&mdash;that was just before he
struck me ... and then I killed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sudden fresh sobs of the younger girl,
smothered as they were in her sister&#8217;s lap, seemed
to wrench her very being. Lanagan glanced at
Leslie; Leslie averted his eyes. There was a prolonged
pause, broken only by the agonised, stifled
sobbing, while she of crime threw her arms shelteringly
around the weaker vessel. But her own
deathly calm she preserved.</p>

<p>Finally Leslie arose slowly and said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry. I have no recourse. My duty is
clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So is mine,&#8221; said Lanagan quickly, &#8220;and it is
this: I will guarantee you, Miss Northrup, the support
of the <i>Enquirer</i>, and I will secure for you as
counsel my personal friend, Mr. William Hadden,
the ablest man in the West, to present your case to
a jury in the proper manner to secure the acquittal
that you are entitled to.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then after one o&#8217;clock. We left Leslie
at the house to bring the girl to the city prison after
she had an opportunity of parting from her family.
Leslie was to contrive not to book her before half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
two to save our &#8220;exclusive.&#8221; By that time
the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Herald</i> would be gone to press.</p>

<p>On our hurried trip to the office&mdash;where I took
vast delight marching in on Sampson with a grin&mdash;Lanagan
supplied me with the missing links.
He spoke of finding a few strands from a manila
rope sticking beneath the radiator and of his instant
surmise as to the precise way in which the
escape had been made. Monahan located Bartlett,
Monteagle&#8217;s former chauffeur, who had taken a
public stand, and from him learned of the rope
that Monteagle had in his closet which Bartlett had
bought. Lanagan knew from his careful search
that the rope was not in the closet when he made
his examination, and he promptly concluded that
Miss Grace Northrup must have known who committed
the crime. She knew the rope was there,
according to Bartlett, and Lanagan rightly surmised
that she must have known of its disappearance.</p>

<p>Robbery not having been the motive, Lanagan
had &#8220;rapped&#8221; to the theory of a jealous or vengeful
woman who had deliberately marred the features
after death. His police experience had included
a case or two where somewhat similar conditions
had been present.</p>

<p>It was from Bartlett that the first tip came on
La Pattini, although he did not know, and neither
did Lanagan at that time, that she was the sister
of Monteagle&#8217;s stenographer. All he knew was
that until he left Monteagle&#8217;s employ she seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to be the favoured of the alliances that the broker
secretly maintained.</p>

<p>Lanagan had discovered that La Pattini had
missed her first show on Monday night, and the
circumstance was sufficient to stir his suspicions,
although it must be confessed that until the development
at the home, where her relationship to
Miss Northrup was disclosed, nothing positive had
been secured against her. The moment the relationship
was made clear, both Lanagan and the
chief had instantly reached the same conclusion.
The &#8220;drive&#8221; had been made and the confession
followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great, Jack, great,&#8221; said Sampson with as much
enthusiasm as his thin blood could support. &#8220;Gad!
What a whaling we gave them! What a whaling!&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Enquirer</i> had smeared the story over three
pages, breaking all make-up rules on type display.
It was a clean exclusive in every detail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Sampson,&#8221; replied Lanagan, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
much to be proud of at that. Only it&#8217;s all in our
game. But I&#8217;ve given my promise and we&#8217;ve got
to get that girl acquitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; said Sampson. &#8220;The
paper&#8217;s yours.&#8221;</p>

THE PENDELTON LEGACY</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp; HAVE always considered Bannerman,&#8221; said
Jack Lanagan, deliberately, &#8220;the crookedest
judge that ever sat on the bench in San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>Attorney Haddon, distinguished in criminal practice,
thumped his office table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have felt that way about
it myself. But he seems to have a hold on the
people. And he makes capital out of the fact that
he ever permits a &#8216;shyster&#8217; lawyer to practise in his
court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simple,&#8221; replied Lanagan. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t have
to. He does business with Fogarty direct. They
take dinner two or three times a week at the St.
Germain. Other times they use the telephone.
Those are things people don&#8217;t know. There aren&#8217;t
many who do outside of myself. But at that I suppose
he might get by with the long-eared public with
the explanation that &#8216;Billy&#8217; Fogarty, bail-bond
grafter and chief of the &#8216;shysters,&#8217; was a schoolmate
of his, raised on the same street, and a member of
one or two fraternal organisations with him. All of
which is true.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bannerman,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t bother with
small cases. He&#8217;s after the big stuff. And I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
a hunch that somewhere back of this case there is
big graft. He has been against us from the start.
And by the Lord Harry,&#8221; Lanagan had arisen, his
black eyes snapping, &#8220;I&#8217;ve put several men in jail,
but here&#8217;s one that I&#8217;m going to get out. Peters no
more murdered that little child of his than I did.
It&#8217;s an absolute obsession with me that there is some
colossal mystery back of the whole thing; some
gigantic conspiracy; and Bannerman&#8217;s attitude to-day
gives me the first direct line to work on I have
had. I am going to work on it again at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charley Peters, a machinist, twenty-five years of
age, had been held to answer by Bannerman that day
to the higher court on a charge of murder for slaying
his week old son. It was a case that had attracted
wide attention when several organisations of
women&#8217;s clubs took a stand against Peters.</p>

<p>He had married, as was brought out at the preliminary
hearing, a woman of the night life, who
had made him, to all report, a capable wife. Originally
from Oakland, after the marriage he had moved
to an isolated little home in the outskirts of the
Potrero, where neither he nor his wife were known.
Before their child was born they had been overheard
by a passing neighbour in a violent quarrel. Peters
freely admitted the quarrel, but explained that, on
the particular night in question, he had been over-wrought
with a particularly hard day&#8217;s labour, returned
home wearied and worried to find a statement
from the doctor for a large amount, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
a moment had become resentful at having another
mouth to feed with nothing but debt before him.
The quarrel, he said, was quickly made up and the
relations of the two were happy up to and after the
child was born.</p>

<p>But the prosecuting attorney had made great use
of the evidence, Bannerman ruling consistently
against the objections of Haddon.</p>

<p>The dead child had been found by a crone, who
was ministering to Mrs. Peters. She had placed it in
a cot in a room adjacent to the mother&#8217;s room, and
had left both mother and child asleep at about six-thirty
o&#8217;clock while she went out to attend to some
small purchases. She returned at about a quarter to
seven to find Peters just home from his work and
sitting by his wife&#8217;s bed. She was asleep. It was not
for some little time later that the beldame, going to
the child&#8217;s cot, discovered that it was dead. Her first
suppressed cry had been heard by the acute ears of
the mother, even in sleep, and she awakened from
slumber to call for her babe. In the excitement that
followed with the husband and the beldame she became
alarmed and, arising, made her way to the adjoining
room to discover the dreadful truth. She
sank rapidly after the shock and died within a few
days.</p>

<p>It was not until the doctor, coming on a call to attend
the mother, examined the child, that the marks
of strangulation were discovered on its little throat.
The police were promptly notified. After one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
night&#8217;s detention the old woman was freed of suspicion
and the police hand fell on Peters.</p>

<p>He protested that he had entered the house not
fifteen minutes before the old woman, had found
both mother and babe asleep, as he supposed, and
had sat down by his wife&#8217;s side to watch, until the
nurse returned.</p>

<p>Such were the principal facts.</p>

<p>Lanagan, working from a stubborn conviction of
Peters&#8217; innocence, had devoted much attention to
the case. Finally, when the police brought Peters
to trial, Lanagan had enlisted the services of Haddon
to defend him. Lanagan had known Haddon
for a good many years; known him when he was a
young prosecutor in the police courts. He had
given him many friendly &#8220;boosts&#8221; in those days.
Haddon had never forgotten. He was frank to admit
that it was the newspaper men at police headquarters,
constantly &#8220;featuring&#8221; him in the police
news, who gave him his real start.</p>

<p>After Bannerman had ruled as a committing
magistrate, binding Peters over to trial for murder,
Lanagan had walked to Haddon&#8217;s office, reviewing
the events of the day.</p>

<p>It was his own conviction, as well as that of Haddon,
that in all fairness, from the evidence presented,
Bannerman should have dismissed the charge. That
he should have held Peters as guilty gave Lanagan
a freshened enthusiasm in Peters&#8217; behalf; because it
appeared to Lanagan that Bannerman was acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
under powerful pressure in finding such a holding,
even with the sentiment created by neurotic women
in favour of a conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep you posted on developments,&#8221; said Lanagan,
as he left Haddon&#8217;s office, cheerfully helping
himself to a fist-full of the cigars which that discriminating
smoker imported for his own use. &#8220;I
may need your service later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sampson,&#8221; he said to his city editor a few moments
later, &#8220;there&#8217;s something funny about that
Peters case, in spite of their holding him to answer.
Haddon thinks as I do. I&#8217;m going to tackle it
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tear into it, Jack,&#8221; said Sampson. &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t turned much up lately, anyhow. Think you
are going stale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Lanagan briefly.</p>

<p>The St. Germain, in the days before the fire, had
a public entrance on Stockton street and a private
entrance on O&#8217;Farrell. Directly across from the
private entrance was a cigar stand, and there Lanagan
loitered for an hour or more.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m right in this thing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Bannerman
and Fogarty will be getting together to talk over the
situation. And if they do I&#8217;ll let them know pretty
pronto that we suspect a nigger in the woodpile
somewhere and see if I can&#8217;t start them to covering
up in a fashion that I can follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was about dusk when he suddenly crossed the
street and went in at the private door. Fogarty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
had entered a few minutes before. Lanagan did
not worry about Bannerman. He would take the
front door, with his high silk hat and his frock coat
and his exaggerated impeccability. That old French
restaurant had turned up more than one good story
in its day, and the upper floor steward was one of
Lanagan&#8217;s numerous &#8220;leaks&#8221; in the night life district.</p>

<p>A dollar to the steward and he had been told the
number of the room where Bannerman was dining.
He knocked at the door, as the waiter might, gently.
It was Fogarty who half-opened it. Lanagan
caught a glimpse of Bannerman, who passed the
plate in the church on Sundays, with a dry Martini
nicely poised at his lips. A champagne cooler stood
comfortably by. Fogarty for a moment seemed
about to close the door, but was quick-witted enough
not to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Want me, Jack?&#8221; he asked, suavely. He was
of the full-fed type of saloon man, a sort of a near-broker
in appearance. &#8220;Come on in and join
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Lanagan, shortly. &#8220;Just ate. I
was curious to see who Bannerman was dining with.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dry Martini struck the table suddenly and
slopped over. &#8220;What a miserable, weak sister of a
crook!&#8221; thought Lanagan. &#8220;I can admire a big
crook, but this breed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear Mr. Lanagan!&#8221; exclaimed Bannerman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
coming forward so hastily his napkin
trailed behind him from his collar, where it had been
tucked. &#8220;I just met my old friend William quite
accidentally. We went to school together, you
know. I seldom see him nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>To hear the notorious &#8220;Billy&#8221; Fogarty called
William made Lanagan smile. Fogarty himself
had difficulty repressing his grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge,&#8221; said Lanagan, smoothly, &#8220;you lie.
Don&#8217;t try to peddle any of that stuff on me. You
see him about three times a week right here in this
room, and you regulate your court calendar by what
he tells you. I had very particular reasons for wondering
whether you were here to-night. I see you
are. So-long, Billy. Enjoy that wine, Judge.
But you better order another Martini.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before either could make reply he backed away
from the door and left the café.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty fair start,&#8221; he muttered to himself,
grimly. &#8220;A judge with Bannerman&#8217;s appreciation
of newspapers will have a lively understanding of
the mess I caught him in. If there is anything
wrong here, there will be a get-together of some
sort quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>His thoughts swung back to the case in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who was big enough to take that
woman away from the night life and make her his
wife, was not the man who was killing their child,&#8221;
he repeated to himself, with stubborn reiteration.
And yet there could not be found hitherto the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
sherd of motive on the part of anyone else to
account for the killing.</p>

<p>And yet, so far as Lanagan&#8217;s investigations had
gone on the case, Peters&#8217; record was found to be ordinary
enough, and neither in his life nor that of his
family was there anything irregular to be discovered
that would create the barest suspicion of any person
seeking to strike at him through the child. There
could be found not the slightest sherd of motive on
the part of anyone else to account for the killing.</p>

<p>The life of the wife began with the meeting with
Peters. What her heritage was or her history before
that time, proved a problem absolutely insoluble
to Lanagan and the police: although the police,
for their part, did little save work to fasten the
crime on the husband, even the brilliant Leslie,
greatest chief of his time, taking that line.</p>

<p>The records of the night life are unwritten, save
where the requiescat is inscribed when a callous
deputy coroner blots the entry at the morgue. Who
she was before she came into the brooding shadow
of the night lights was a secret that, if any of the
wastrels there knew, they guarded. It is more than
likely that they did not know. It is a great, wide
way, the entrance there. She had come by that way
one of a multitude; into the shadows and out.
Whether she went out for happiness or ill, whether
to a free life or a sombre death, few there cared to
ask, even if they recalled her at all.</p>

<p>Ceaselessly Lanagan had searched that district.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
He could trace her back to the time when Peters met
her and no further. That incident had made some
trifling stir merely because the &#8220;guy who got
&#8216;copped&#8217; on Gracie&#8221; had taken her away and really
married her; or so they had heard.</p>

<p>Otherwise she had come into that Tenderloin district
as many of her transitory sisters, with a suit
case; but whether from far or near no one could say.</p>

<p>The influences that were eager to land Peters in
the penitentiary were unquestionably the same that
murdered the child; so Lanagan argued under the
spell of his new theory. They had not slain the
mother, directly; but they may have shrewdly calculated
the effect upon her, in her precarious condition,
of the death of the child: knowledge of which could
scarcely be kept from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us suppose, then,&#8221; mused Lanagan, &#8220;let
us suppose that someone wanted the child out of
the way and now wants the husband out of the
way. It would be possible to hang him for that
crime. In the present state of the public mind,
and with Bannerman holding him to answer for
murder, life is the least he will get. What happens?
The child of &#8216;Gracie Dubois&#8217; is dead.
The husband is, or soon will be, civilly dead. She
is dead: but that does not appear to have a moving
cause. Why the child&#8217;s death and the father&#8217;s imprisonment?
Undoubtedly so that someone may
profit. But who? Who, concealed back of the
shadows of the night lights, kept grim watch on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
&#8216;Gracie Dubois&#8217;? Who was concerned with the
fate of that poor wretched girl anxious only for
redemption, for a decent life? What &#8216;dead
hand&#8217; is it that has slain her issue and blighted
her poor hopes for happiness and her passionate
ambition for motherhood?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bannerman, with his high silk hat and his
frock coat and his impeccable respectability, came
before him insistently; Bannerman, with his dry
Martini and his quart of wine and his vis-a-vis dinner
with &#8220;William&#8221; Fogarty.</p>

<p>Many thoughts that apparently flash into the
mind spontaneously are but the products of a chain
of thought carried consistently over a period of
time.</p>

<p>It was so with Lanagan and his sudden theory
of the &#8220;dead hand&#8221;; of a case that in some manner
reverted back to a will or to an inheritance. He
was rather surprised that the thought had not occurred
sooner; but he had been busied with other
thoughts and theories, and it was not until the way
had been cleared that, in its logical time, that theory
had suddenly struck him with conviction. And
obviously it was the only theory that had not as yet
been exploited by him; that some place back in the
earlier life of that poor waif of the night life there
might lie the solution of the crime&mdash;financial reasons
for desiring to be rid of her progeny and her
natural legatee, her husband.</p>

<p>The question intruded: why was not the husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
murdered as well? There might be many
reasons, but one would answer: his imprisonment
would suffice even if he were not executed; and if
he managed to avoid any penalty, there would be
time enough to see him.</p>

<p>And leading back to that &#8220;dead hand&#8221; theory of
his, Lanagan could see but two links: Bannerman
and Fogarty.</p>

<p>From the neighbourhood of the St. Germain he
got me on the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cover Fogarty&#8217;s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Pick up some of
the bunch and drop in casually. Keep your eye on
him if he&#8217;s there, and who he talks to. Spend money
and get soberly drunk, if necessary to allay any
suspicion that he is being watched. Get Sampson
on the &#8217;phone by ten o&#8217;clock. There may be a
message for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t the faintest idea what it was all about,
but Lanagan&#8217;s voice was as snappy as a drill master.
I went to the reporter&#8217;s room at police headquarters
and led a bunch to Fogarty&#8217;s to rattle the
dice for a round or two. It was pay night and
money was free. If Fogarty, after he came in,
had any suspicions of me&mdash;he knew that Lanagan
and I always worked together&mdash;they were soon
allayed. The dice rolled blithely for an hour or
two with one of the boys dropping out occasionally
to &#8220;cover&#8221; the police beat for the others while the
play went on.</p>

<p>But nothing happened and I slipped away to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Sampson on the &#8217;phone. It was ten o&#8217;clock. He
was didactic as usual, and as irritatingly brief: &#8220;Report
to Lanagan. Room 802 Fairmont. Take the
back stairs and make the room above all things
without being seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>That same old tingle that always shot up my spine
when Lanagan was calling me in on the smash of
one of his grand climaxes, shivered up to my hair
roots. In a general way I knew the quest he was
on, but that his search should have led him to the
Fairmont hotel, on the very crest of aristocratic
Nob Hill, was sufficient without further information
to set my imagination humming.</p>

<p>The door was open and I entered, noiselessly.
Lanagan was lying on the bed, smoking. He
jumped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said quickly, indicating a chair
drawn up before the door leading to the adjoining
room&mdash;they were suite rooms but used separately.
&#8220;Sit there until I get back and take notes on what
you hear. Keep your ear glued to that hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had cut with his pocket knife an inch hole
in the panelling of the door. He had whittled it
so nicely that it was not quite cut entirely through.
&#8220;You will find you can hear everything that is
said in an ordinary tone of voice. There&#8217;s no one
in there now. An Englishman named Holmes has
the room. Pretty soon I expect him and Larry
Leighton in there with a girl. I am going out and
get hold of Leslie. Lock the door after me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
keep your ears open for us when we get back. I
won&#8217;t knock, but will turn the handle once or
twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the lay?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No time to talk now,&#8221; he flung back over his
shoulder, and was gone.</p>

<p>It was probably twenty minutes later when the
occupants of the adjoining room entered. There
were two men and a woman. I could distinguish
perfectly Leighton&#8217;s sonorous voice. He had been
a lawyer of standing in years gone by, but lately
had been involved in one or two transactions a
trifle &#8220;shady&#8221; in character, chiefly pertaining to
the administration of estates; but nothing had ever
been proved against him nor had the matter ever
got into such shape that the papers could use it.
So far as the general public was concerned, he
stood well enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt I could not be wrong,&#8221; Leighton was
saying. &#8220;And I am glad that you are satisfied.
It must be a source of great satisfaction to you,
Miss Pendelton, to be restored to your name and
inheritance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only sorry now it did not happen before
poor father went,&#8221; the girl replied, with a tremble
in her voice, and I fancied she was crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally,&#8221; it was the Englishman&#8217;s voice,
&#8220;I am satisfied of the identity. But of course my
principals in London will also have to be satisfied.
It would be best to leave at once, I think, for England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
For the sake of the Pendelton name we
must work secretly and quietly. I would not want
the matter in the public prints for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was listening with such intentness that it was
some time before the soft and insistent grating of
the doorknob caught my attention. I tiptoed to
the door. Lanagan entered. In another moment
Leslie came in and after a few moments of interval,
Brady and Wilson, two of Leslie&#8217;s steadiest
thief-takers, stepped in softly. There was big
game afoot of some sort!</p>

<p>Leslie had his ear to the door. He remained
there for some time, and then motioned Brady,
who took his turn, followed by Wilson.</p>

<p>Lanagan was sitting on a corner of the little
table, swinging his feet lazily, but following every
move made by the officers, and watching every
shade of expression in their faces. Leslie took
another turn and a half smile played over Lanagan&#8217;s
face as that veteran Chief finally stepped over
to him and put out his hand. Lanagan gripped it.
Not a word was spoken. Motioning to Brady and
Wilson, Leslie stepped out and we followed.</p>

<p>He rapped on the door to the adjoining room.
Leighton opened it, a look of enquiry on his rotund
features. As swiftly as though a swab had been
rubbed over it, his look of enquiry shaded into
one of alarm, as he recognised Leslie. We filed
in and Wilson snapped the lock behind him and
stood at the door, Brady walking quickly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
window and taking his position there. Not a
word had as yet been spoken. Leighton stood as
though stupefied. The Englishman, a dapper, well-dressed
man of probably forty, smoking a cigarette
at ease, raised his brows as we entered, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>On the edge of the bed the girl was sitting, her
wide eyes following Leslie. It was evident that
she knew him by sight. Her resemblance to Mrs.
Peters was striking. Both were women of that
blonde, doll-faced type so frequently found in the
night life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leighton,&#8221; said Leslie, &#8220;the jig is up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leighton sank into a chair. The Chief went to
the connecting door, tapped for a moment, and
then jabbed his knife through Lanagan&#8217;s ear hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;See?&#8221; he said, laconically. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
listening there for thirty minutes. Gertrude
Pendelton is dead; you know she is dead and her
child with her. And this woman here,&#8221; turning
sharply to the girl, &#8220;knows that she is not Gertrude
Pendelton. She knows perfectly well that she is
playing a crooked &#8216;lost heir&#8217; case for you,
Leighton.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though he had been a jack in the box, Holmes
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, Sir!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;why, what are you
saying! Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie threw back his coat, displaying his diamond-studded
shield.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>&#8220;Chief of Police Leslie of San Francisco,&#8221; He
said, shortly.</p>

<p>With a swift movement the girl&#8217;s hand went
to her corsage and in a flash Lanagan had hurtled
across the room and a tiny dagger spun to the
floor. She threw herself back upon the bed, crying
in sudden hysteria:</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have let me done it! You might
have let me done it!&#8221; she wailed bitterly. Lanagan
was wrapping up his hand. He had got the
point of the dagger through the ball of his thumb
in the rush. She jumped up again and threw herself
at the feet of Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first crooked trick, so help me, Chief!
He dragged me into it! What was I to do? It
looked easy and it was a way out of the Tenderloin!&#8221;</p>

<p>Leighton was glancing heavily, his lips apart,
from the door to the window as though planning
an attempt to escape by either means.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been shading pretty close on one or two
things lately, Leighton,&#8221; said the Chief grimly.
&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t think you had it in you to take a
chance at the scaffold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that, Chief?&#8221; gasped
Leighton, with a sickly attempt at composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means,&#8221; thundered Lanagan, &#8220;that you are
the man back of the murder of the real Gertrude
Pendelton&#8217;s child, and the indirect killing of Gertrude
Pendelton, who was Mrs. Peters! He means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that you are the man back of Fogarty, who is the
man who secured the conviction, in Bannerman&#8217;s
court, of Peters. That&#8217;s what he means!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan wheeled on the Englishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much money have you already paid
Leighton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thousand pounds for producing this girl.
He was to get four thousand more when final proof
of identity was accepted by my principals in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie and Lanagan exchanged glances. It was
big pickings for Larry Leighton. Twenty-five
thousand dollars in all; properly handled by Fogarty,
it would go a long way to grease the wheels
of justice in the police court.</p>

<p>Leighton arose, shaking like a palsied man, and
tottered, rather than walked, to the Chief. He extended
his wrists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put on the bracelets, Chief,&#8221; he said, in a voice
that was but a shadow of his rich voice. &#8220;I took
my chances, I&#8217;ll take my medicine. The girl
hasn&#8217;t done anything yet you can hold her on. She
knows nothing about the other thing. The doctors
had given me two years to live&mdash;kidneys
gone&mdash;and I saw a chance for a big clean-up and
the German springs. It might have saved me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big!&#8221; interrupted the Englishman, awed, &#8220;one
hundred and fifty thousand pounds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, Chief,&#8221; resumed Leighton. &#8220;I did
the trick with the child myself, I wouldn&#8217;t trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
anybody else. The night was pitch black and there
are no houses right near there, you know. I waited
till the old lady went out. After I finished the
child, I was going to get the mother, but the front
gate slammed. It was Peters coming home. I
slipped out the back door again. I wanted the
husband out of the way, on general principles. I
did not know what his wife might have told him
and he was better off, in case any publicity attended
the restoration of the girl here, where he couldn&#8217;t
squeak, in case his wife had ever told him her real
name and story.</p>

<p>&#8220;This girl here, a Tenderloiner, that I picked
up because she looks a good bit like Mrs. Peters,
seemed to have nerve enough for the deal, and she
was to collect the estate and give me half. It was
a big gamble. You&#8217;re right about the scaffold,
Chief. I never took any such chance before, but
this was a &#8216;get-away&#8217; stake for life for me, and
I took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no direct dealings with Bannerman.
There&#8217;s nothing on him. I had talks with Fogarty
but paid no money. In a general way he gathered
I wanted the man across, and I guess he gathered,
too, that there would be a big clean-up all around
at the end of it. There&#8217;s no case on anybody except
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing on Bannerman or Fogarty that
would make a case in court, possibly,&#8221; said Lanagan,
curtly, &#8220;but plenty that the <i>Enquirer</i> can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
print. You&#8217;re loyal to your pals, Leighton.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appeared that Leighton, through a newspaper
advertisement, got into communication with the
London firm of lawyers of which Holmes was the
confidential representative. They had a theory
that the girl they sought had gone to San Francisco.
A runaway at the age of fifteen, Gertrude Pendelton
had been estranged from her father. She had
taken the downward path, but the father, relenting
on his death bed, willed his estate to her, and his
executors had for months been endeavouring to
locate her.</p>

<p>Leighton immediately began his plotting to foist
an impostor upon the executors and their lawyers.
It must be remembered that they had accepted him
as a reputable lawyer. He had made a secret trip to
England and had secured a fairly complete record
of the places the Pendeltons had lived in while
the daughter was still with them. Originally residents
of various parts of the British possessions,
the family had settled at Applegate, where the
mother died, the father following her some months
later. At Applegate there were none who had ever
known the daughter. Leighton&#8217;s investigations in
England failed to reveal anyone who had in fact
ever known her, the Pendeltons only coming to
England to settle down there a few years before.</p>

<p>To Leighton&#8217;s scheming brain, the thing looked
perfectly simple.</p>

<p>The murder plot was secondary. It had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
his original plan to find the real Gertrude Pendelton
and if possible strike some bargain with her.
Equipped with a picture of her taken at the age
of fifteen, he had finally traced her, to find her respectably
married. Consequently, it was hardly
likely that he could strike any combination with
her that would give him the &#8220;haul&#8221; that he
sought to make. Then, with her alive, there was
always danger that she would disclose her identity
to her husband. When the child came along,
Leighton, keeping close tab on the Peters, concluded
that inevitably motherly pride in the redeemed
woman would bring about an attempt at
a family reconciliation. Then would come to her
the knowledge of her father&#8217;s death and of her own
inheritance.</p>

<p>He determined on one bold stroke: kill mother
and child on the gamble that what did happen,
would happen: that the husband would be accused.</p>

<p>With the husband safely imprisoned, or possibly
executed, his path with the impostor would be unimpeded.
He had coached his impostor well on the
information gained on his English trip.</p>

<p>So much for Leighton&#8217;s story. Lanagan&#8217;s story
was startlingly simple. After telephoning for me
to cover Fogarty&#8217;s, he had returned to watch the
St. Germain. Fogarty finally came out and Lanagan
shadowed him to the Mills building. He came
from there shortly, in company with Leighton, and
Lanagan, still in the grasp of his &#8220;dead hand&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
theory, and knowing Leighton by sight, and his
reputation in the inner circles for tangling up in
estate cases, dropped Fogarty and followed Leighton.
He went directly to the Fairmont. When
he went to the desk to call for Holmes, Lanagan
was close at his side. Leighton did not know him
by sight. Learning which room Holmes had, Lanagan
was fortunate in securing an unoccupied room
adjoining, and he was in his room ten minutes after
Leighton had entered Holmes&#8217;. Being fortunate
enough to get the room merely hastened the climax,
because the case was already clearing in Lanagan&#8217;s
mind.</p>

<p>His ear to the keyhole of the door connecting
the two rooms&mdash;many of the rooms in that hotel
are so joined, to permit of them being thrown into
suites&mdash;he had heard a fragment of conversation
here and there, and knew that Leighton was bringing
a girl for the Englishman&#8217;s examination who
was being sought as a missing English heir. Finally
the Englishman, shortly after eight o&#8217;clock,
had concluded to go with Leighton to bring her,
desirous evidently of satisfying himself that she
was in the Tenderloin, which seemed to be a point
in their argument.</p>

<p>With Holmes and Leighton out of their room,
Lanagan had set to work to whittle a hole in the
door for better hearing facilities, and then had
sent the message to Sampson that brought me to
his room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>To Lanagan&#8217;s ranging mind, the thing was as
clear as print. He had traced his connection past
Fogarty down to the last figure in the combination.
It was a &#8220;long shot,&#8221; perhaps, that Leighton had
put the real heir out of the way in order to impose an
imposture on the estate and thus divide probably
a full half; but it was on &#8220;long shots&#8221; that Lanagan&#8217;s
extraordinary brain usually won out.</p>

<p>The narratives were ended. Lanagan turned to
Leslie:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want Peters here, Chief, to give the last note
to my story. To prevent any &#8216;leak&#8217; from the
county jail, I will have Haddon get Superior Judge
Dunlevy to telephone a verbal order of release to
the jail for Peters to be brought to the city to see
his council. It&#8217;s rather unusual, but has been done
before, and Dunlevy will do it. I think I&#8217;ll get
Haddon in for the finals, too. He&#8217;s been in the
case pretty deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was probably an hour later before Haddon
dropped into the room. He had sent a machine
for Peters, Dunlevy telephoning the order. A few
moments later Peters, in charge of a deputy sheriff,
entered and in brief and business-like fashion the
facts were laid before him. It was a little too
much for him to grasp all at once.</p>

<p>When he finally did, it was the Englishman who
brought matters to a business basis by remarking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leighton certainly seems to have been extremely
positive about the identity of Mrs. Peters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Did you know that she was Gertrude Pendelton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Peters, &#8220;I married my wife as I
found her, and I asked no questions. She made me
a good wife. She never talked about herself or her
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she have any keepsakes, any old trinkets,
any pictures?&#8221;</p>

<p>Peters unbuttoned his shirt. &#8220;Only this,&#8221; he
said, producing a locket attached to a fine gold
chain. &#8220;She asked me to wear it when she was
taken to bed, and if anything happened, to give it
to the babe. The police missed it in searching me.
It&#8217;s her father and mother, I think, although she
never said.&#8221;</p>

<p>With eager fingers Holmes opened the old-fashioned
locket.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Captain and Mrs. Pendelton,&#8221; he said,
simply. &#8220;He looks as he looked the day before
his death.&#8221; A silence fell upon the room, as he
snapped the locket and, bowing profoundly, passed
it back to Peters. He then continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;My mission here has certainly had a curious
termination. I will remain until the court matters
against you are all disposed of. I would suggest
then that you return with me to London, so that
you can be on the ground in the arrangements for
transferring the estate to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no arrangements,&#8221; said Peters.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishman stared incredulously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want it! Don&#8217;t want one hundred and
fifty thousand pounds, three quarters of a million
dollars? It will escheat to the Crown if you refuse
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it then,&#8221; said Peters, stubbornly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want it. Why should I take something my
wife didn&#8217;t want? There must be something
wrong about it somewhere. Why should I make
money by the death of my wife and child? If
she were here to share it&mdash;if only my boy were
here&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke down for the first time since his arrest,
and sobbed, throwing his arms over his head in a
wild burst of grief. Finally he composed himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back to my trade,&#8221; he said, simply.
&#8220;Hard work is the best thing for me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to Lanagan and their hands met in a
long, hard clasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it can be done, I&#8217;ll turn the money over to
you, Mr. Lanagan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Peters, no. I&#8217;ve only done a newspaperman&#8217;s
work; what the <i>Enquirer</i> pays me to
do. You&#8217;re all man; and it&#8217;s been a pleasure to
clear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Leslie, again the master newspaper mind,
calculating the minutes swiftly slipping around
after midnight, he snapped:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in your hands now, Chief. Keep everybody
here and stall around for an hour or so, while
Norton and I give the town a story that, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
doesn&#8217;t make a case in court against Fogarty and
Bannerman, will at least chase Fogarty out of
town till it blows over and beat Bannerman out of
the nomination for Superior Judge. His name
comes before the convention to-morrow night.
We&#8217;re off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then to me as we swiftly pelted out of the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;Key up to it, Norrie; this is some stem-winder!&#8221;</p>

AT THE END OF THE LONG NIGHT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;EXTRA! EXTRA!&#8221; in shrill diminuendo
awakened Jack Lanagan from the very
heart of his morning slumber. The morning paper
man sleeps late and nothing short of cataclysm
or the cry of an extra is likely to awaken him.
Lanagan was from his bed to the window in a lanky
leap hailing the newsboy.</p>

<p>It was the <i>Evening Record</i> with a &#8220;screamer&#8221;
head and two hundred words of black-face type.
Lanagan swept through it in a comprehensive flash.
With more speed than was his custom he thereupon
dressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Swanson!</i>&#8221; he said. &#8220;Gad, what a story!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat on the edge of the bed, more leisurely to
roll a brown-paper cigarette and read the story more
carefully. Stripped of flaring headlines, it was as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;All hope for the safety of Captain Robert
Swanson, the retired millionaire shipping man who
disappeared on Wednesday evening, was dissipated
this morning, shortly after 9.30 o&#8217;clock, when the
body of the well-known philanthropist was found
in a subcellar room in the notorious Palace Hotel
in Chinatown.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>&#8220;Death was due to strangulation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life had probably been extinct three days, and
it is the police theory that Captain Swanson went
directly to the hotel or was lured there on the evening
of his disappearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;His watch and valuables were found on his
person.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as a hasty examination could discover
no one saw him enter the hotel, which bears an
evil reputation and is occupied by the lowest
type of denizen of Chinatown and the Barbary
Coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;The room where the body was found is one of
several that have been dug out beneath the basement
and is used entirely by opium smokers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief of Police Leslie has ordered all available
detectives on the case and arrests are expected at
any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means,&#8221; finally grumbled Lanagan,
&#8220;that I get no day off to-morrow to split a quart of
Chianti with mine host Pastori.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swanson,&#8221; he ran quickly back in his mind,
&#8220;is president of the Seamen&#8217;s Bank; director of
the Cosmos Club; director of a dozen corporations;
trustee of his church; sound as a nut at sixty-five;
solidly established in the old conservative families
of Nob Hill, with a family of married children likewise
solidly established in the solidest kind of respectability
and a wife who is a silvery-haired saint
if there ever was one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>&#8220;Yet he, a man who probably didn&#8217;t know such
a place as Chinatown&#8217;s Palace Hotel existed until
that night, is found dead in the lowest sink of that
hole. The extremes of the social system met in
his end and the place of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinatown Palace Hotel of the days just
before the fire gave that quarter of San Francisco
obliteration, the one thing that could cleanse it,
was a sorry second to the pretentious hostelry on
Market Street. A ramshackle structure, illy lit
through its crooked corridors and musty rooms
with ancient gas jets, it looked more, in its complete
dirt and dinginess, like an exaggerated rabbit warren.
Three stories above ground and one or two
below, cut up into rooms, the largest not more than
eight by ten, the smallest just large enough for a
bunk and an opium layout, it had survived by some
miracle the health authorities to hive in musty murk
the off-scourings of a city. Once, when Portsmouth
Square was the civic centre, it had harboured
the kings of the early gold days.</p>

<p>The rooms were larger in those days; the front
suites that gave ease to the idling, new-made
Cr&oelig;sus had long since been cut up into five, six,
seven, or eight, as the increasing congestion of the
quarter threw an increasing swarm of vermin to
its recesses.</p>

<p>Save for white &#8220;dope fiends,&#8221; known in the
vernacular of the police as &#8220;hops,&#8221; &#8220;cokes,&#8221; or
&#8220;morphs,&#8221; users of opium, cocaine, or morphine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
it was inhabited solely by Chinese, some of them
coolie labourers, but the most of them likewise
&#8220;fiends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Below the basement floor were a dozen rooms not
high enough for a man to stand erect in. The light
of day never entered. What light they received
came from one main gas jet in the corridor or the
occasional flash of a policeman&#8217;s pocket light as the
Chinatown squad made their rounds. Save for
the members of the squad, and at times a jaded
police reporter, idling from the reporters&#8217; room in
the near-by Hall of Justice on a quiet night through
the district with the squad sergeant, it is probable
no white man save the &#8220;fiends&#8221; of the district had
ever before gasped for breath in that foul den&mdash;no
white man, that is, before Captain Robert Swanson,
who entered there one night never to emerge.
It was three days before one of the denizens of the
subcellar, finally realising that the occupant of the
next bunk was not in the stupor of drug but the
stiffness of death, made his way with frantic hippity-hoppings
to the first member of the squad he could
find and reported the matter, not forgetting to
whine for his ten cents for so doing.</p>

<p>Such, in substance, were the facts in the mystery
that set the city and the coast&mdash;Swanson was a
notable figure in shipping circles&mdash;in a ferment
for a week.</p>

<p>For, more than the initial fact of finding the
body in Chinatown&#8217;s cesspool, five days had now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
elapsed with not one single additional fact of consequence
to clear the mystery. Suspects without
number had been jailed. Every ex-convict,
&#8220;fiend,&#8221; vagrant, or questionable character of the
district, white, yellow, or black, male or female,
had been put through the police mill. The opium
dens had been emptied of their wastrels, blinking
like bats in the light of day. Swanson&#8217;s past and
his present life were run under a high-power lens;
his servants&#8217; and his employees&#8217; lives and the lives
of his former servants and former employees; Chief
Leslie was a fellow member of the Cosmos Club
with Swanson, and if any additional good to his
natural police pride were necessary to spur him on,
that afforded it. Every recourse that police experience
could adapt or devise was applied.</p>

<p>Always there was lacking motive: that mainspring
for crime.</p>

<p>That Swanson had by any chance been addicted
to the drug habit was early dismissed. Practically
every hour of his methodical life could be accounted
for for months back.</p>

<p>But in so far as his movements were concerned
from the moment he left his doorstep on Wednesday
evening until the body was found, he may as
well have left his doorstep invested in an invisible
mantle, for no living person that could be located
had seen him alive.</p>

<p>There was one peculiar circumstance. He had
worn that night a heavy ulster overcoat, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the night had not been chilly, and Mrs. Swanson
had remarked on it at parting. The coat was not
found with the body.</p>

<p>It is not exaggeration to say that in physical
output Lanagan worked harder than any three reporters
or detectives during the first five days of
the case. He did not take me into his confidence:
he seldom did until the &#8220;smash&#8221; approached on
any story. He smoked eternally or chewed to pulp
his own select brand of rank Manilas, or consumed
innumerable cigarettes. Lanagan never had to
bother with the daily routine of a story; that was
all left to me. His work was the big &#8220;feature&#8221;
stuff. He might not write a line for a week and
then he would saunter into the picture with a news
sensation that would upend the town.</p>

<p>But there seemed to be no &#8220;upending&#8221; on this
case. During the five days that had elapsed the
big portion of the work had fallen to me. Lanagan
had absolutely not turned a trick. On Wednesday
evening at midnight, as I turned in my story
for the day, identical as I felt it would be with the
other two morning papers, Lanagan &#8217;phoned me to
meet him at the Hall of Justice.</p>

<p>I drifted down there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just wanted to tell you,&#8221; was his greeting,
&#8220;that I am going to disappear. Don&#8217;t look for
me. I will discover myself when the time comes.
I&#8217;m going to lose myself up in Chinatown, for the
solution of that story is there, and I&#8217;m not coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
until I&#8217;ve landed something and choked off the
side remarks of the <i>Times</i> and <i>Herald</i> outfit,
if I stay there for the balance of my natural life.
The police can hang as they please to their hoary
old dogma that a &#8216;hop head&#8217; never commits murder.
Just because they&#8217;re so positive, I am going
to take the other tack; at least until I have proved
their theory to my own satisfaction. There isn&#8217;t
a man outside the frequenters of this quarter knew
of that subcellar and that&#8217;s the theory I am going
to stick with now. Keep in pretty close touch with
the office so I can get you in a hurry if anything
turns up. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment he was walking rapidly up
Washington Street to disappear down Dupont, out
of sight for three days.</p>

<p>The story had run eight days and a dearth of
fresh angles had thinned it out a trifle, when, on
Saturday evening, along about ten o&#8217;clock, as I
hung around the local room hoping against hope
for a call from Lanagan, it came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet me in front of old St. Mary&#8217;s,&#8221; he said,
shortly, and I thrilled instantly with that same
premonitory tremor that always came over me when
the climax was on. I sped down Kearney Street
and in the shadow of the church steps picked him
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorrett is watching me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s been
covering me for days.&#8221; Dorrett was the oldest
special policeman in Chinatown and generally held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
to be a &#8220;leak&#8221; for the <i>Herald</i> through personal
friendship for a former police reporter, now city
editor of that paper. In such fashion do papers
develop their &#8220;sources&#8221; of news. &#8220;I have one
clue that may be the key to the solid brick wall we
have been up against. And I am not going to lose
that key to the <i>Herald</i> via Dorrett,&#8221; concluded
Lanagan, as he suddenly stepped fully into the glare
of the gas street lamp on the corner just as Dorrett
sidled up. I saw that Lanagan had deliberately
exposed himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Dorrett,&#8221; he remarked in that sinister
tone he could assume so well on occasion, &#8220;some
of these days I shall actually trip over you if you
persist in blundering beneath my feet. You might
fall quite hard in that case and hurt yourself.
However, just tell Cartwright&#8221; (city editor of the
<i>Herald</i>) &#8220;that I am going to hand him a package
of nitroglycerin right on your own particular
little bailiwick, will you? Please run along now,
like a good little special policeman, because we are
going to lose you&mdash;thusly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and ran for a California
Street car just lumbering past us up the hill and I
followed suit. After a few blocks he crossed
through the car and dropped off on the other side.
Scouting cautiously back toward Chinatown by way
of Washington Street, drifting along with eyes
wide for Dorrett, we finally made Ross Alley,
where Lanagan stopped for a fraction of a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
at the wicket of the gambling house at No. 8.</p>

<p>At that time it was a strict rule of the gambling
&#8220;joints&#8221; that a white man could not enter. Personally,
for all of my four years&#8217; dubbing around
on police, I never had been able to enter a Chinese
gambling house when the play was on. Yet the
lookout flashed one glance at Lanagan, grinned yellowly
and ingenuously, and the massive solid oak
door before us swung noiselessly open and we
passed quickly through. As it shut behind us I
heard a faint click-click, and glanced back. Three
separate two-by-four scantlings, heavily re-enforced
with iron, had dropped back into their sockets. The
door was as solid as a concrete wall against the
axes of the Chinatown squad; the theory being that
by the time the squad had the door battered down,
the players had departed through some secret runway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melodrama?&#8221; laughed Lanagan at me. &#8220;But
I had to come by the back door, as it were. I
wouldn&#8217;t like to have any stray police or reporters
or Dorrett suspect I was about to interview the man
I am. They might smell a rat, possibly. We are
more isolated among these hundred Chinks, gambling
their fool heads off, than we would be in one
of Leslie&#8217;s dark cells.&#8221;</p>

<p>We passed directly through the long room with
its eight high tables, at each of which ten or a
dozen impassive Celestials, with chopsticks, beans,
and teacups, stood engaged in the contraband pastime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of fantan. At a table or two a pie gow game
was running, and in a corner dominoes. The air
was so heavy and heated that I felt the perspiration
starting in an instant. The Chinese gambler, if he
is winning, sticks in that thick atmosphere for hours
at a time.</p>

<p>At the rear of the room was another door, likewise
barred in triplicate. Here another lookout
grinned friendly at Lanagan and pressed on an innocent-appearing
nail head in the wainscoting and
the bars dropped and the door opened to a steep
ladder. We went down about ten feet into a blind
areaway between two buildings.</p>

<p>It was as black as your derby hat. But Lanagan,
the marvellous, stepped ahead with assurance and I
followed him gropingly. In another moment he
rapped faintly on what I took to be a section of the
brick base of the building, a click sounded, he took
me by the arm, pulled me after him, another click,
and the next moment a blaze of electric light discovered
us to be in a small lounging room elaborately
appointed in Oriental furnishings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Mist&#8217; Lamagum!&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice came from a corpulent, twinkling-eyed,
richly garbed Chinaman just arisen from a
massive chair of ebony and mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Fu,&#8221; said Lanagan, sinking into another
massive chair and motioning me to do likewise.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend Norton, Fu. Norton, Mr. Fu
Wong, otherwise known to me as Why Because.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
You will understand &#8216;why because&#8217; presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Becaus&#8217;? I tell you,&#8221; said Fu Wong,
chuckling. &#8220;Him funny boy, Mist&#8217; Lamagum.
He, whatyoucalem, jolly me. You likem smoke?&#8221;
He pressed a button on the arm of his chair and a
flowing-garbed Chinese boy appeared with rich
Havanas on a tray, together with individual teacups
and two-piece teapots for three.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find See Wong?&#8221; Lanagan asked abruptly,
while I studied Fu, whom I knew by reputation
as one of the Chinese merchant princes. &#8220;I
am in a hurry, Fu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I catchem. He say Charley drive aut-o-mob-<i>eel</i>.
Charley live there three, fo&#8217; wicks. She
cry one time See bringem tea: &#8216;Oh, Charley!
Charley! Why fo&#8217; you do him? What&#8217;s mala you,
Charley?&#8217; She stop quick see See. Why? Becaus&#8217;?
See, he donno. He say Charley he usem,
what you call &#8217;em? Hop.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time since this story broke, that
singular flashing, almost like a cat&#8217;s eyes, flamed
into Lanagan&#8217;s dark eyes and they shot a responsive
shiver of high tension interest through me, because
I knew that at last he had struck the trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done more for me than I can ever
repay,&#8221; said Lanagan at parting. &#8220;You are a remarkable
man, Fu Wong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fu laughed boyishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Becaus&#8217;? You save my sto&#8217; good
name? I help you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>As we went back out the way we came in, Lanagan
enlightened me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fu is president of the Suey Sing Tong. There
is a Chinaman, Swanson&#8217;s cook, See Wong, whom
I have been hammering on for two days. Of all
the household servants, I have a vague suspicion of
him. I couldn&#8217;t land him. Finally I looked up his
affiliation, found he was a Suey Sing man, and then
I enlisted the services of Fu Wong. See Wong
would have to talk to his tong leader where the police
or the reporters couldn&#8217;t drag information out
of him with a team of mules. He purely and
simply wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;sabe,&#8217; and that&#8217;s all the satisfaction
you could get.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why Because&#8217; is not only proprietor of one of
the biggest bazaars here and a director of the
Chinese Bank, but he is also proprietor&mdash;I am telling
you Chinatown secrets and not to be repeated&mdash;of
of the gambling house we came through and several
others. He is one of the powers of the quarter.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was an English tourist robbed in his
bazaar once of a couple of hundred dollars and I
was sent up here. Fu laboured under the impression
that the entire sixteen pages of the <i>Enquirer</i>
were going to be turned over to that particular robbery.
He felt the disgrace of the thing keenly,
as any high-class Chinaman would, and personally
offered the Englishman back the money. That was
a good story. For some reason Fu, not understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the American newspaper idea of &#8216;human interest,&#8217;
elected to think I had written a eulogy of him
deliberately. I could have had half his store at
that time, I guess, if I had wanted it. But I took
a cigar and a cup of tea, and ever since that time
I have been taken inside the inner circle up here.
The room we were in is a runway through the
basement of the bazaar next door in case of a raid.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Charley&#8217; was a chauffeur named Thorne, employed
by Mrs. Swanson about three months ago
for several weeks. He was one of the numerous
wastrels that that woman of unostentatious but
magnificent charities had under her protection.
There are scores in and about the city, men and
women, boys and girls, that she had taken from the
under side of life and put on top. I didn&#8217;t see him,
but some of Leslie&#8217;s men did and found nothing
suspicious. Had they known he was a &#8216;hop,&#8217; however,
they might have thought differently. It establishes
a very clear apparent connection between
Swanson and the Palace Hotel and the only definite
clue that has been turned up. We will save a lot
of time by getting his address from Leslie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan was through with Leslie in a few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is going home, but will be on tap with Brady
and Wilson if we need him later,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
got curious when I mentioned Thorne, but promised
to lay off until he heard from me. Thorne
lives at Lombard and Larkin, where, in view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Mrs. Swanson&#8217;s undoubted suspicion that he committed
the crime, coupled with See Wong&#8217;s charge
that he is a &#8216;hop,&#8217; we will now proceed to call on
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were there in a few moments. It was a
squalid lodging house, in charge of a slatternly beldam.
She didn&#8217;t know whether Thorne was in or
not. He was kind of loony, lately, she thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; said Lanagan, genially. &#8220;Has
Charley been so that he couldn&#8217;t be out the last
week? He wasn&#8217;t feeling well last time I saw him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t seen much of him this week,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know about it, but I am beginnin&#8217; to think
he is one of them there fiends. He is actin&#8217; something
awful sometimes lately, what with his skippin&#8217;s
and hoppin&#8217;s. You can go on up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door was locked, but it was a rickety affair
and the lock yielded to the pressure of our shoulders.
A man who might have been any age from
twenty to forty swung himself to a sitting position
on a disordered bed and glared at us with eyes that
were wide open but only half seeing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Full of hop; and I might as well jam him on a
gamble,&#8221; said Lanagan, in an aside to me as he
stepped quickly over and pulled Thorne to his feet,
slapped him across the face, and sat him down in a
chair. A high-pitched, querulous protest was voiced
at the treatment, and then Thorne whimpered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are so cruel! What have I ever done
to be treated so cruelly?&#8221; He began to cry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>&#8220;Done? You snivelling viper, put on your shoes
and come with me to jail. You murdered Robert
Swanson and you are going to hang for it. Get
up and come along.&#8221; Again Lanagan caught him
a sharp slap across the face. This time Thorne did
not whimper. A look of cunning came into his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting your wits back pretty quick, now, eh?&#8221;
sneered Lanagan.</p>

<p>Thorne stared. It seemed for a moment his
clouded eyes entirely cleared; and then the film of
the drug-sodden brain fell over his eyes again, and
he relapsed to his hunched position. He was shivering
and rocking himself, his angular knees drawn
up to his chin, clasped around with his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&#8221; His voice was pitched
high again like a woman&#8217;s. &#8220;Why is everyone so
cruel to me? I am very nervous, as you can see,
gentlemen. I really need something to quiet my
nerves. It is the doctor&#8217;s orders, really. Would
it be asking too much, now, to ask for the loan of
ten cents? Oh, dear&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Thorne!</i>&#8221; Lanagan, his aspect actually ferocious,
leaped before the half-arisen suppliant. I
shrank back myself, his acting was so consummately
done.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you ten cents, you viper! You murdering,
crawling, poisonous viper! I&#8217;ll give you
the condemned cell at San Quentin and the death
watch and the black cap, and the quick drop, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
they crack that snake&#8217;s neck of yours into a dozen
pieces! That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll give you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Chattering, jabbering incoherently, his long, lean,
sharp-nailed, claw-like hands working spasmodically
before his face and toward Lanagan, the fiend huddled
back. He glanced from side to side, his head
lolling, as though seeking some avenue of escape
by a desperate leap.</p>

<p>Lanagan&#8217;s eyes were within a foot of his face.
Thorne began to foam at the mouth. I thought he
was going into a fit as I watched, fascinated, the
horrible scene. Bearing down upon the wretch with
savagery in his voice and manner, Lanagan hammered
on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give you ten cents! What do you want with
ten cents? You&#8217;ll never get another shot of coke
as long as you live, Thorne! Never in this world!
You are coming with me now, coming where you
will never need coke again! Coming to your death
by hanging for murder! <i>Not another shot in all
this world will you ever get!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>With a shriek that was more animal&#8217;s than man&#8217;s,
Thorne suddenly lunged forward. Quicker than
the dart of a snake&#8217;s head, those hands, with their
long, lean, writhing fingers, had twisted around
Lanagan&#8217;s neck. With a strength that was the
strength of temporary insanity, he flung Lanagan
from him and fell with him. Then, like a lean
gorilla, he shook Lanagan&#8217;s head from side to side
while he screeched fearful imprecations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>&#8220;<i>You lie! You lie! I&#8217;ll get all I want! That&#8217;s
what he said, and I killed him, and I&#8217;ll kill you, too!
Yah! Yeeah!</i>&#8221; He trailed away into a maniacal
scream.</p>

<p>I hurled myself at him, but the fiend, for the
moment at least, had the strength of three men. I
finally managed to get in a blow that settled him.</p>

<p>Lanagan, rubbing his bruised neck ruefully, rose
slowly. He was panting a little but chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Score one for mental suggestion on a weak
subject,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t figure those
scrawny hands had quite that much strength. This
murder is clearer than print. We all but re-enacted
the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my boy, to establish the connection that
would bring a man of Swanson&#8217;s position to a rendezvous
at the Palace, to arouse the slumbering
demon in this human orang-utang. It&#8217;s rather a
commentary on that hoary police doctrine that a
dope fiend never commits murder. I was right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within thirty minutes Chief Leslie and Brady,
and Wilson, his right-hand men, were in the room,
and Lanagan swiftly detailed the circumstances.
Thorne had come to and was shaking and shivering
as the drug wore out of his system, leaving
him nerve-racked. He did not attempt to repudiate
his utterance, but sullenly admitted the murder.</p>

<p>In view of the words overheard by See Wong,
there was but one person to clear up the mystery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Leslie, Lanagan and I hurried in the chief&#8217;s machine
to the Swanson home, nearly midnight as it was.
That they had had Thorne once under examination
and had permitted him to go was a source of bitter
chagrin to the chief. Thorne showed none of the
ravages of the habit that men of weaker physique
exhibited; the day the police picked him up he had
happened to be comparatively normal, and consequently
he had passed safely through the quiz.</p>

<p>Mrs. Swanson had not yet retired, and, upon
learning that the chief was one of her late callers,
summoned us at once to the drawing-room. She
had one of those splendid faces seen occasionally in
the aged, where strength of mind or religious fervour
has brought endurance of lifelong secret pain
of body or soul. The calmness of a noble resignation
looked forth in a slight clouding of her clear
eyes and expressed itself in the faint traces of suppression
about her mobile lips. The gleaming,
snow-white hair, combed straight back from a forehead
of a remarkable breadth in a woman, invested
her like an aureole.</p>

<p>She was a woman probably of sixty years.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will appreciate, gentlemen, I trust,&#8221; she
said in a low voice of refined modulation, &#8220;that I
have endured much and am still suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very painful errand we are on, Mrs.
Swanson, and we will endeavour to be brief,&#8221; said
Lanagan in a voice that a Chesterfield might have
envied for courteous inflection and gentleness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
expression, &#8220;but nevertheless it is an errand that
must be performed.&#8221; He glanced at the chief, who
nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking as a newspaper man,&#8221; continued Lanagan,
&#8220;it is my wish at all times to spare the feelings
of those, particularly women, with whom I am
brought into relation. But the true newspaper man
is a seeker after truth, and he must follow as definite
a path as the police follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an eloquent pause. She gazed from
one to the other during the interim, as though striving
to read their thoughts. It was evident that the
undercurrent that these skilled cross-examiners intended
to convey had carried home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; finally. Neither Lanagan nor Leslie
spoke. There was another pause. She said at last:
&#8220;You have some information to impart to me? Or
some information to seek?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We desire to inform you,&#8221; said Leslie slowly,
and with just a shade more of hardness in his tone
as the detective began to work in him, &#8220;that we
have under arrest the confessed murderer of your
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned involuntarily forward in her chair
and grasped the arms so hard that her knuckles
showed white through the fair skin of her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we desire to inform you,&#8221; added Lanagan
quickly, &#8220;that the name of your husband&#8217;s murderer
is Charles Thorne; and we desire to ask you
what the motive was for the murder of your husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
by Charles Thorne; <i>and why, when you suspected
that Charles Thorne was the murderer, you
did not immediately notify the police?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Her hands slowly relaxed their grip on the chair
arms as she sank back into its depths. Curiously,
in the way the light struck down at her hair and her
face, it seemed that the beautiful halo of white that
had invested her, and the delicate, well-preserved
whiteness of her skin, turned suddenly to dirty grey.
If ever the blight of age settled visibly in fact or
in fiction, it settled upon her then.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;have&mdash;Charles&mdash;Thorne&mdash;under&mdash;arrest?&#8221;
she said, and her very tone was grey. She
did not deny the truth of the charge; she did not
express satisfaction that the murderer was found;
she merely asked whether they had Charles Thorne
under arrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes closed and her head dropped suddenly
back against the chair. We stepped swiftly forward,
but before we could take any measures to revive
her, her eyes had opened again. The lips
moved. She was speaking, but so gaspingly that
we bent to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the end of the long night,&#8221; she said with
many halts; &#8220;the end of the long night. A life&#8217;s
nightmare is done. God have mercy on me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped completely. Then:</p>

<p>&#8220;God pity all mothers who bear as I bore&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Another long pause. She was by strong effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
retaining the clarity of her faculties under some
heavy shock. She repeated:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who bear as I bore!&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence became acutely poignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be told,&#8221; she breathed finally. &#8220;You
have asked me why I did not tell you my suspicions.
I will tell you now. Charles Thorne&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her next words came so low that had it not been
for the pregnant silence of the great drawing-room
they could not have been heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Is my son.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I found I had been holding my breath; and I
glanced quickly at Lanagan, to see his breast falling
with a deep exhalation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband did not know,&#8221; she continued,
colourlessly. &#8220;Charles Thorne does not know I
am his mother. I have tried to live a full Christian
life. I have given by tens of thousands to aid the
erring. I have thought to make all atonement....</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet the blood of my blood slew the heart
of my heart, my dear husband, one of God&#8217;s noble
men....&#8221;</p>

<p>After that wrenching confession her normal poise
began by degrees to return as the strength of an extraordinary
mind began to assert itself. The story
was soon told: of an alliance before her marriage to
Swanson, of the boy, taken by the father, to be sent
back to her after fifteen years. The dissolute
father, on his deathbed, sent Charles back to the
mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>For fifteen years since that day she had steadily
stood sponsor for the boy. To her husband he was
but one of the many others of her objects of charity.
It may be said the boy inherited the dissolute traits
of his father. Finally, her own children by Swanson
all marrying, that profound mysterious quality
of motherhood prompted her to make one last effort
to redeem the boy under her own eyes, and she
adopted the dangerous course, for her, of bringing
him to the house as a chauffeur.</p>

<p>That he was given to drugs she did not know.
Thorne had been caught in a series of petty thefts.
Swanson had finally been compelled to discharge
him. He had left the house with maledictions upon
Swanson. Instinctively she had felt he was the
author of the crime.</p>

<p>Considering all of these circumstances, and understanding
the character of the fiend and his paternity,
it is evident that in his brain, constantly weakening
under drugs, became fixed a sinister purpose to
work out some scheme of revenge on Swanson for
driving him from a rich home and a cozy living,
with ample funds and opportunity for a secret indulgence
in his weakness.</p>

<p>As it subsequently appeared, Thorne did not
originally plan murder. Some abortive scheme of
blackmail had but half formed in his crazy brain.
He lured Swanson with a cunning letter, full of explicit
directions, to the Palace Hotel by writing that
he was seriously ill there. He begged that Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Swanson be not informed until after Swanson had
seen him. He wanted an opportunity to redeem
himself, he wrote; and Swanson, as warm-hearted
as his wife, and not caring evidently to worry her
needlessly about the condition of one of her charges
until he had made an investigation, set out on his
errand of humanity, never to return.</p>

<p>He wore his ulster, obviously so that he would
not be recognised going alone into the Palace Hotel.
In the subcellar he had met Thorne. There
was a prolonged talk, and Swanson made the mistake
of chiding the fiend on his habits. Desire coming
upon him strongly, Thorne finally exhibited himself
in all his ugly weakness, and the spectacle was
too much for the eyes of Swanson, unaccustomed to
such sights. He was stooping his way out of the
little room after sternly refusing Thorne&#8217;s appeal
for money, when the long, lean fingers of the half-insane
man, with some congenital strain outcropping
perhaps of that vagabond, dissolute father,
found an easy goal in a man already half-suffocated
in the thick air of the place.</p>

<p>Alarmed, when his fit had passed, at what he had
done, and fearing to rob the body, Thorne had
quakingly slipped into Swanson&#8217;s ulster and made
his way in terror to his own room. First he had
journeyed to the foot of Powell Street, weighted the
coat with a rock, and cast it into the water of the
bay. It was subsequently recovered and served as
the single bit of incriminating evidence to substantiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
his confession. His letter to Swanson, in
Swanson&#8217;s pocket, he had taken with him to destroy by
tearing into fine bits.</p>

<p>Such were the salient features of a most extraordinary
crime as ultimately established.</p>

<p>But to return to Mrs. Swanson&#8217;s drawing-room,
where Lanagan is speaking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles Thorne does not know, then, that you
are his mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who does know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No living person save myself and you gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case, then, Mrs. Swanson,&#8221; said Lanagan
simply, &#8220;your secret will die with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>She choked in attempting to speak, and, tears
streaming from her eyes, bade us each adieu.
For my part I confess I was blinking like a boy.
The outer doors closed behind us. Then:</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to the room for you, chief,&#8221; snapped Lanagan
laconically. &#8220;Throw Thorne in at 2:15.
Charles Thorne, a former chauffeur, murdered
Swanson after attempted blackmail failed. You
stand, of course, chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand, Jack?&#8221; replied that sterling officer, &#8220;it&#8217;s
in so deep it can only come out when the last drop
leaves my veins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that,&#8221; said Lanagan. &#8220;Now, Norrie,&#8221;
sharply, &#8220;get together! We have exactly <i>fifty-five
minutes to press time</i>!&#8221;</p>

THE DOMINANT STRAIN</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SAMPSON,&#8221; said Lanagan, &#8220;there&#8217;s something
queer about that Robbins case. Professional
second story men aren&#8217;t returning to the
scene of a $10,000 burglary and sending by messenger
a written proposition to return the property
for a cash settlement. They know how and where
to negotiate the stuff and they take no chances; particularly
not with one of their number under arrest&mdash;assuming
the Ward boy is one of them. And
that is another queer angle: seasoned crooks don&#8217;t
operate with sixteen-year-old boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you account for the ring found on
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your theory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t any. But ten &#8216;second-story&#8217; cases in
three months in one district winding up with a $10,000
job is against all form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dig into it then. Here, see who this is as you
go out. May be about the suspect. Same name.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed Lanagan a visitor&#8217;s card. Scrawled
across it in a nervous hand was: &#8220;Jennie Ward.
Important.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the ante-room a girl with a crutch arose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
meet him, but he motioned her back to her seat.
She had the pinched face and the wistful sadness
of those condemned to life but half-whole. It was
evident before she spoke a dozen words that she
came as so many others come to the newspaper ante-room:
in futile, uncomprehending protest at the entire
system of News.</p>

<p>It was her brother, Jimmy, who was under arrest,
and she said he was innocent. Jimmy told her he
found the ring, therefore he did find it, because
Jimmy never told her a lie. She did not see why
papers should print such things, even if he had been
arrested, and why they did not try to prove a boy
innocent rather than aid the police in trying to prove
him guilty.</p>

<p>Lanagan listened patiently at first, with an occasional
question; and then he listened with a deepening
interest as the girl&#8217;s fervour grew.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only the rich whose wrongs you right!&#8221;
she exclaimed at last passionately. &#8220;What rights
have we poor? I cannot afford even a lawyer.
Mamma does washing. She is old and timid, and she
was afraid to come to the papers. I mostly educated
myself, sir; I had to. I have learned the piano at
the Sunday school. I have a little class of pupils
there. The teacher helps me get them. I just
teach the first lessons, you know. I make $4.25
a week. Mamma makes about $7 when she is not
sick. Jimmy has been making $8, with a raise to
$9.50 coming the first. So you see we manage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
make out, all of us together, and send my three little
brothers to school.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now&mdash;now&mdash;all the people on the street
are talking about us and my little brothers won&#8217;t go
to school&mdash;the others call them names&mdash;everyone
saw Jimmy&#8217;s picture in your paper to-day&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please help us? We haven&#8217;t any
men folks to fight for us now with Jimmy locked
up. Please, sir, help us get Jimmy out!</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to police headquarters and waited
hours and hours to see Jimmy&mdash;and then&mdash;and
then finally the detectives&mdash;they took me and said
I would see Jimmy&mdash;but they took me to a room
and shut the door&mdash;and they swore at me&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They said I&mdash;better tell everything or go to&mdash;jail&mdash;why&mdash;why
they talked like <i>I</i>&mdash;knew about
the robbery and they were&mdash;going&mdash;to arrest&mdash;me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She fainted; just drooped quietly back into the
chair, wearily, hopelessly, woefully, without so much
as a sigh. Lanagan breathed quickly as he ministered
to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little sis!&#8221; he said, softly. &#8220;Plucky little
mother of the tenements! Taking a full-grown
man&#8217;s place! But what a handicap!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes opened. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she fluttered, her thin,
sensitive lips quivering in apology, &#8220;I fainted, didn&#8217;t
I? How queer. I never fainted before. I cannot
afford to give way like that. Sometimes, though!
Oh, sometimes I wish I could! I wanted to in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of the detectives&mdash;my brain whirled and whirled
and whirled with fire like pinwheels but I wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;I
wouldn&#8217;t give them the satisfaction!&#8221; Her
slight hands with their long fingers clenched; her
eyes sparkled. &#8220;Harrigan. That is his name.
He was the worst. The brute! oh, if I were a man!
I would kill him for what he said to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind Harrigan. Leave him to me,&#8221; said
Lanagan. &#8220;You are only exciting yourself. Go
home now and try not to worry. We are going to
look into your brother&#8217;s case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, with shining eyes. There
were at no time any tears. She had been trained in
a life where tears are inadequate.</p>

<p>Lanagan watched her as she hobbled on her one
crutch down the hall to the elevator, her useless limb
swinging loosely. She was a pathetic little figure,
with her man&#8217;s brain, her grown woman&#8217;s pride, and
her little misshapen body; a fourteen year old girl,
wearing &#8220;long clothes&#8221; in grim earnest. A quick
pang shot through him; cripples always saddened
him. They have infinitely so much less than the
meanest wastrel who has health.</p>

<p>&#8220;The judgment of a cold-blooded detective
against the judgment of a loyal sister,&#8221; mused Lanagan.
&#8220;Which is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour&#8217;s study at police headquarters of the reports
on all ten of the burglaries established in
Lanagan&#8217;s mind one settled conviction: they were
all committed by the same author, and whoever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
was&mdash;whether an individual or a gang&mdash;had first
become reasonably familiar with the interior arrangements
of the houses entered, and with the daily
routine of the households.</p>

<p>In the Robbins case, for instance, from the time
the last member of the household left the bedroom,
or second floor, to go down to the dining-room on
the first floor for dinner, until a member of the
household returning upstairs found the evidences of
the burglary, only twenty-five minutes had passed;
and yet in that time the thief or thieves had entered
the house and had left it after cleanly ransacking
three bedrooms. An open bathroom window and
the drain pipe to the ground gave mute evidence of
the burglar&#8217;s route.</p>

<p>In all of the cases only precious stones were taken:
nothing monogrammed was touched, nor watches,
silverware, trinkets or bric-à-brac. But this was of
no particular consequence. The average expert
thief prefers the precious stones. Removed from
their settings they are difficult to identify and easy
to negotiate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professional work, all of it,&#8221; muttered Lanagan,
arguing to himself. &#8220;But what about that
message?&#8221;</p>

<p>The extraordinary boldness that had marked all
the crimes culminated in the Robbins case when a
man, with smoked glasses, heavy moustache, soft
hat pulled down and ulster turned up, gave a small
boy ten cents to carry an envelope to the Robbins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
home, but a block from where the man stood. Enclosed
in the message, which offered to return the
jewelry for $5,000 cash, was a brooch that had been
among the articles stolen. It was sent as proof that
the offer was genuine. The message said the police
were not to be notified. If the family desired to
negotiate, they were to send the boy back with the
single word, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they would be communicated
with later.</p>

<p>In the excitement of receiving the message under
such singular circumstances a member of the family,
forgetting or disregarding the caution, telephoned
the police, holding the boy in the house.
The police misunderstood the call, and a patrol
wagon load of reserves clattered up to the door
within ten minutes, under the impression murder
was being done.</p>

<p>Naturally, the man on the corner had ample time
to escape. No further offers to negotiate came to
the family. On the second day the police placed
under arrest the Ward boy. He was employed as a
helper with the Phoenix Vacuum Cleaning Company,
which had been engaged a few days before at the
Robbins home.</p>

<p>&#8220;And at the start he made a bad case, superficially,
by his contradictions,&#8221; reflected Lanagan, reviewing
the case.</p>

<p>In their investigations the detectives, examining
the two men and the helper, Jimmie Ward, who had
operated the cleaning apparatus at the Robbins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
house, learned that the boy had been noticed that
morning examining a diamond ring. Asked where
he got it, he had replied he found it on the floor of
the washroom at the establishment. No one claimed
the ring. The matter was called to the attention of
Cutting, the proprietor and manager of the company,
but he knew of no customer having reported
such a loss.</p>

<p>The detectives&mdash;Harrigan and Thomas&mdash;took
the boy to headquarters for further questioning, and
he had there said he found the ring on the sidewalk.
On that contradiction he was placed under arrest
and locked up in detinue.</p>

<p>Further, the police regarded as damaging the fact
that a robbery a week previous had been committed
in the same neighbourhood in a home where the
cleaning apparatus had been engaged, the Ward boy
serving as the helper in that house also. He had
worked with a different crew of men than had been
on the Robbins house, and this fact, in the police
theory, eliminated the remaining employees of the
company as it was highly improbable that they were
all in a &#8220;second story&#8221; ring. They redoubled their
efforts to find the supposed connections of Ward on
the theory that he operated with an outside gang.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Jimmy said he found the ring and if he said he
found it he did find it,&#8217;&#8221; said Lanagan, repeating the
sister&#8217;s earnest declaration. &#8220;Well, for her sake&mdash;I
hope he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hour after hour Lanagan, tirelessly, kept at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
rounds, visiting in turn each of the ten homes in the
western addition that had been robbed during the
last three months.</p>

<p>Long before he reached the Robbins home, the
last of the ten, he had formed his startling theory.
In nine of the cases he had discovered that which
he set out in search of: a constant condition present
in them all. There was just one question that he
wanted to ask at the Robbins home.</p>

<p>He found the home in a flurry of excitement.
Police headquarters had rung up and asked that a
member of the household come at once to the detective
bureau to identify if possible a bracelet that
it was believed had been among the stolen articles
and that had been recovered.</p>

<p>Lanagan, arriving just as the senior Robbins was
leaving in his automobile, was invited to accompany
him. He did so; but first he had asked and had had
answered the one question he came to ask.</p>

<p>In the office of O&#8217;Rourke, night captain of detectives,
they found O&#8217;Rourke, Harrigan and
Thomas grouped around a woman, huddled down on
a chair. Lanagan caught a low sob, a helpless, forlorn,
frightened sob, that sent a curious sensation of
nausea through him. He stepped quickly forward
to gaze down upon the misery-racked form of the
cripple, Jennie Ward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything! Oh, I don&#8217;t know anything!&#8221;
she wailed. &#8220;I found it on the door step!&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Rourke had turned as they entered. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
stepped to his own desk, holding the bracelet toward
Robbins.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my daughter&#8217;s bracelet, sir,&#8221; Robbins
said. &#8220;It was my Christmas present to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrigan, listening, nodded in satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I guess we had better
throw the little gutter snipe in, cap; a little pressure
now and she&#8217;s bound to squeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; Sobs were shuddering from the
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Squeal!</i> You damned clodhopper! Give her a
bullet and kill her now if you are trying to! You
don&#8217;t throw her in!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Lanagan. He had whirled from the huddled
form to send the words cutting through the
air at Harrigan like a whiplash. The girl flung up
a white face in a swift look of wild hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I don&#8217;t know anything, Mr. Lanagan! Don&#8217;t
let them put me in jail!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw herself from her chair in an attempt to
clasp his arm but her withered and shrunken limb
crumpled under her and she sank to the floor with a
sharp cry of pain. Lanagan leaned and lifted her
to the chair.</p>

<p>Harrigan had an ugly look as he measured the distance
from himself to Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Harrigan; you rotten thief. Clodhopper
is too mild for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bum,&#8221; said Harrigan, with deadly levelness.
&#8220;You drunken bum.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>Lanagan&#8217;s leap was catlike. It took all the mighty
O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s strength to tear his fingers free. Lanagan
was not a Queensbury fighter when tackling two
hundred pounds of policeman. O&#8217;Rourke had Harrigan
by the arms. Thomas had Lanagan. For a
second or two there was not a sound but the panting
of grappling men. Then discipline told. Harrigan&#8217;s
arms relaxed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are relieved from duty, Officer Harrigan,&#8221;
said O&#8217;Rourke. &#8220;Until I lay the matter of your
insubordination before the Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective turned on his heel and walked from
the room, stopping at the door. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get you, Lanagan,&#8221;
he said. Lanagan ignored him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Jack,&#8221; said O&#8217;Rourke, grimly, as Thomas
freed the reporter. &#8220;Why won&#8217;t we throw this girl
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Lanagan, still breathing heavily,
&#8220;she is innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. That is enough. If you won&#8217;t take
my word ring up the Chief and he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Rourke knew the close friendship between Lanagan
and Chief Leslie and the confidence the chief
had in his judgment. He gazed doubtfully at the
girl and then at Robbins. Secretly, he respected
Lanagan also and he was impressed by Lanagan&#8217;s assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t justified in holding the girl,&#8221; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to Robbins. Then to Lanagan: &#8220;All right. You
win.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as Lanagan left the room with the girl to send
her home in the police automobile, O&#8217;Rourke had an
afterthought. He turned to Thomas.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might just as well cover up. Watch the
house to-night. There&#8217;s something queer about this
whole business that I don&#8217;t get yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever happens keep calm until I see you
again,&#8221; was Lanagan&#8217;s last counsel to the girl.
Through the scene in O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s office she had kept
crouched down in her chair, watching with wide
eyes; save for one quickly shrilled: &#8220;<i>Give it to
him!</i>&#8221; as Lanagan&#8217;s sinewy fingers twined around
Harrigan&#8217;s throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was terrible of me to say that, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t help it! He is a bad
man! I feel it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s what we call a &#8216;wrong&#8217; detective,&#8221; said
Lanagan, drily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think about him any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have Norton,&#8221; he said, some moments
later to Sampson, and to me he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to cover 211 Clementina Street.
Don&#8217;t bother anybody. Just see who goes in or out
or hangs around there. I&#8217;ll pick you up later down
there. Wait for me no matter what happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>He jumped into a taxicab at the curbing and
whirled away out Market Street. I hastened to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
station, in that gloomy, narrow street of rookeries.
Almost opposite 211 was a deep doorway. I flattened
back in the shadows, trusting to luck that the
occupants were all in bed and that no one would
walk up on me. I was not bothered. An hour
passed and another. I heard someone come out of
a house a few doors above me and saunter down the
street toward me. I huddled back. The figure
passed within six feet of me. By the dim rays of
the gas lamp on the corner, throwing its feeble area
of light a dozen yards, I recognised Detective
Thomas.</p>

<p>He slipped into the side door of the corner saloon.
&#8220;Off his job, whatever it is,&#8221; I said to myself.
&#8220;Something should happen now. It usually does
in such cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did. Noiselessly on the opposite sidewalk passed
a figure in a heavy black overcoat with a high collar
turned up around the ears and a soft hat pulled
down. In front of 211 the figure stopped for a fraction
of a second, it may have been to look for something
that had been dropped; but it appeared to me
to fumble an instant by the steps. The figure then
passed rapidly on.</p>

<p>Thomas, a fresh cigar between his teeth, sauntered
back to his post. The figure that had stopped at
211 had disappeared around the corner at Seventh
Street. Thomas had certainly missed the episode
entirely.</p>

<p>There was a long interval. The door at 211<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
opened, slowly. A girl came out, finally; a girl
with a crutch. She came down the three steps,
looked up and down and across the street, and suddenly
dropped down and I could see that she was
rummaging in the space under the stairs.</p>

<p>Stepping easily, I saw Thomas, his cigar still puffing
leisurely, cross the street. He was almost beside
the girl before she saw him. There came a faint
cry of alarm, quickly smothered, as she straightened
up, her back to the house. I walked quickly to them
in time to hear Thomas&#8217;s voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, miss, find any presents? Little late for
Santa Claus, isn&#8217;t it? But let&#8217;s see. Let&#8217;s just see
what you were looking for under those stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped to his knees, threw his pocket flash
about, and arose, a small package wrapped in a newspaper
in his hand. The girl was staring with
startled, wide eyes. She was breathing quickly, her
thin bosom rising and falling. Thomas wheeled on
me, was about to snap at me, thought better of it,
and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you&#8217;re dropped to me. I might as well
let you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tore off the paper wrapping from the package
and in the flash of his pocket light I saw the glitter
of a pair of diamond ear drops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you make them?&#8221; he asked, triumphantly.
I nodded. The jewels unquestionably answered the
description of those stolen from the Robbins home.
It came to me like a physical blow, the shock that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
such a frail, broken bit of humanity as the little
back alley waif before me was entangled in a thieves&#8217;
gang. I knew she was the suspect&#8217;s sister. She still
held her defiant place against the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess this time, young lady, you will go in,&#8221;
said Thomas, tersely. &#8220;Do you want anything
from the house? Got any thing to say? You are
going to jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>She began to tremble violently, but her lips were
still compressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she managed to say at last. &#8220;No! I
was watching! I know now! I know! But I will
not talk to you! Please don&#8217;t waken my mamma or
my little brothers&mdash;let us go&mdash;now&mdash;if I must.&#8221;
She started to hobble away in feverish haste, shaken
with sobs that she would not permit to escape her
lips. Seldom have I been affected with such a sense
of sadness as came over me then: all of the tragedy
that would have been in the situation with even a
whole girl under such circumstances was doubled by
her condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got her dead to rights that time,&#8221; chuckled
Thomas to me. &#8220;She&#8217;ll spill now sure. The rest
of the stuff must be cached around here somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think there is no question about the Ward
boy?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the slightest. And she is in and is covering
up. They&#8217;re all crooked, these back alley rats.
There&#8217;s more in the gang, of course. That stuff
was put there, I suppose, to-night, for her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
&#8216;shove.&#8217; Probably she peddles it. You never can
tell how these gangs operate.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced again at the pitiable little misshapen
thing dragged away from her home to a cell and an
iron bed at the city prison and I couldn&#8217;t trust myself
to reply to Thomas.</p>

<p>By a curious change that is gradually making me
less valuable as a newspaper man the older I become
in the business, I find myself unconsciously taking
sides against my paper with fellow beings whose
frailties or sorrows make them grist for the newspaper
mill. I felt so toward this poor girl now, a
victim of congenital influence in all likelihood; obviously
a product of the malnutrition of the under
classes.</p>

<p>Thomas took his prisoner away in a taxi and I
hurried to a telephone and gave the story to Sampson
in that fashion. I then hastened back to Clementina
Street, where to my great relief, I was picked up by
Lanagan within a few moments.</p>

<p>I related everything to him. When I had finished
his eyes shone more brightly than the gas jet over
our heads. Never had I beheld him so far from the
composure for which he was noted. For a minute
or two he anathematised O&#8217;Rourke by all the carded
oaths and a few that he invented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back, back in jail, is she! So, O&#8217;Rourke
couldn&#8217;t take my word! We&#8217;ll see, oh, we&#8217;ll see!
Wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran up the steps to 211. After a long period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the door opened. It was the mother. Briefly Lanagan
explained what had happened. The poor old
toothless soul was about past being shocked further.
But quickly Lanagan, in that compelling way of
his, calmed her fears. He promised that she would
have her son and daughter back&mdash;before daylight.</p>

<p><i>Before daylight!</i> It fairly took my breath away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Jack? Give me a line,&#8221; I demanded
in excitement. &#8220;Heavens, man, it&#8217;s quarter to two!
How are you going to get a story in the paper to-night
now? You&#8217;ll only break it for all the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan stopped short in his rapid walk and laid
his hand on my shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in this game fifteen years, Norrie,&#8221; he
said, with a solemnity new in him. &#8220;Let me tell
you something, and I say it who have the right:
there comes a time just once every so often when a
newspaper man puts humanity above his paper. Remember
that. You are betraying no trust with your
paper when you do; you are betraying your trust
with yourself, with your fellow man, and with your
conscience when you do not. This is one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all. But many times in the years that
have whirled by since then and since that strange,
marvellous man passed out of the newspaper life of
the west, have those words come back out of the
dark of a back alley, to guide me.</p>

<p>He was not working for an &#8220;exclusive&#8221; now; he
was working to free a mite of a cripple girl and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
stunned and misused brother from the inner tier of
cells at the city prison.</p>

<p>He said no more. At Market Street he flung
open a taxicab door and we jumped in. He called
an address to the driver. It was Chief Leslie&#8217;s
home. We were there within fifteen minutes.
Lanagan held his finger on the button until the door
swung open and the Chief himself appeared,
wrapped in a lounging robe, his hair tousled, his
beard rumpled, but his grey eyes wide and alert.
Lanagan brushed in and I after him. He sat the
Chief down on a settee and for ten minutes he hammered
away. At last Leslie&#8217;s fist banged the settee
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Lord Harry, you&#8217;re right! And I want
to flash that bird again! It all comes back to me
now; I couldn&#8217;t make out the other day where I had
seen him before. Little stouter, but same man or
I&#8217;ll cut my throat!&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the stairs to the next floor three at a time.
Within five minutes he was back, fully dressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got your machine out here yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lanagan. &#8220;But don&#8217;t forget the
Wards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leslie stepped to the telephone stand and to his
private line to headquarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prison,&#8221; he said, shortly. &#8220;Prison? Give me
the matron. Mrs. Conness? Take that Ward girl
into your room and give her the best you have until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
I get down. Give me Andrews. Sergeant Andrews?
Take that Ward boy to the matron&#8217;s room
and give him the best you have until I get down
there.&#8221; He hung up the receiver. &#8220;Come on.
We&#8217;ll pick up Brady. He lives just around the
corner. We better get Maloney, too; he&#8217;s not far
away. If this is the bird I think it is, we&#8217;ll take no
chances. Known as the &#8216;Swallow.&#8217; Two timer,
Moyomemsing prison. Porch climber. Came out
here about fifteen years ago and reported on, saying
he wanted a chance to make good. We kept track
of him for a couple of years. He was clerking and
doing the right thing. Then we lost him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t identify him that closely,&#8221; said Lanagan.
&#8220;But he&#8217;s the man who did this trick and the other
nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within twenty-five minutes Brady and Maloney
were crowded into the machine with us. Lanagan
gave a direction. At Pacific Avenue and Octavia
Street we stopped, in the heart of the fashionable
western addition. With Lanagan and Leslie in the
lead, Brady and I next and Maloney bringing up
the rear, we straggled along for several blocks.</p>

<p>At Washington and Buchanan Streets the Chief
and Lanagan had stepped back and signalled us.
We closed up. From the middle of the block on
Washington Street came the sound of a taxicab
starting. Leslie looked around the corner as the
machine came towards us, and stepped to the street,
flashing his shield. The machine stopped. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
door opened. A head appeared. A familiar voice
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Chief! What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Detective Harrigan stepped out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re up,&#8221; said Leslie, with a bitter oath.
&#8220;You are under arrest. Brady, search the prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quick as a knife blade springs back Harrigan&#8217;s
hand went to his hip; but as quick as he was, Leslie
was quicker. There was a click, click and Harrigan
stood before his superior officer and his brother detectives,
manacled. With practised fingers Brady
was running through his clothes. He passed over
Harrigan&#8217;s revolver, handcuffs and billy. He
brought forth a leather wallet. Leslie tore it open.
It held an assortment of jewelry, jumbled together.</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; he said, his voice shaking with rage, &#8220;you
knew it was the Swallow, did you? And you have
been shaking him down for half the loot? Well,
Officer Harrigan, you and the Swallow will be
splitting cobble stones inside of a month. You
dirty, rotten, gutter scut! You were framing to
send two little kids to prison, were you? I wish I
had let you pull that gun! We&#8217;d have saved the
county the expense of a trial!&#8221;</p>

<p>He tore Harrigan&#8217;s coat back and ripped his star
from his breast. He ground it under his heel until
the number it held was obliterated, and then he
hurled it spinning into the air and over the corner
house. It landed faintly on a distant roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>Harrigan noticed Lanagan for the first time and
sprang for him, raising his manacled hands. But
Leslie stopped him with a drive to the jaw that sent
him staggering back against the machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him in, Maloney,&#8221; ordered the Chief.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen enough of him. We&#8217;ll get along without
you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrigan said not a word. He stumbled into the
machine, Maloney following. It drove away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Lanagan,&#8221; said Leslie, &#8220;I wish you were
on my staff. You could have O&#8217;Rourke&#8217;s job to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Chief, I&#8217;ll be satisfied if you send
O&#8217;Rourke to the fog belt,&#8221; replied Lanagan, sardonically.
&#8220;Put a man like Royan in his place and
you&#8217;ll have the kind of head the bureau needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Royan goes,&#8221; said the Chief. &#8220;You&#8217;re entitled
to something on this night&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to hurry. Our man may have
noticed that taxi incident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. Harrigan came out of the
house.&#8221; We walked up the street. &#8220;Take the rear,
Brady,&#8221; said Leslie, and the detective stepped quietly
down the cement path at the side of a fairly pretentious
home. Leslie, Lanagan and I tiptoed up
the front steps. We stood to one side, while Lanagan
took the door. He rang twice. Footsteps
came. It was evident Harrigan&#8217;s host had not yet
retired.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you, Harrigan?&#8221; the voice came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
inside before the door opened. Lanagan mumbled
a yes. The door swung back and Donald Cutting,
Esq., proprietor and general manager of the Ph&oelig;nix
Vacuum Cleaning Company stood staring at Lanagan
from the brilliantly lighted hallway. For an
instant he was speechless. Then he shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what the devil do <i>you</i> want around here
at this hour of the morning? What gets into you
reporters, anyhow? Has a citizen got any rights
in his own home at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t many that you have.&#8221; It was
Leslie. He had swung to the door directly before
Cutting.</p>

<p>His revolver was at Cutting&#8217;s waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just keep your hands a little higher, Cutting:
you&#8217;re pretty nifty with those digits of yours. Now
back in there, so we can all sit down and talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cutting stood an instant as though frozen, and
then mechanically stepped back. We all walked in.
The door was closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Swallow,&#8217;&#8221; said the Chief, &#8220;you&#8217;re through.
We&#8217;ve got Harrigan with the goods. Where&#8217;s the
rest of the loot? I mean outside the Robbins stuff.
We&#8217;ve got that located.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cutting&#8217;s head dropped to his hands. He sat in
silence, bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Donald, what is it? Is there any trouble?&#8221;
A woman&#8217;s voice came over the balustrade. He
straightened up, as though an electric current had
shot through him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>&#8220;Nothing, Molly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just some old
friends dropped in on me. I will be at liberty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife?&#8221; asked Leslie. &#8220;My wife,&#8221; replied
Cutting.</p>

<p>In another moment she was sweeping from the
broad stairway in a silken kimono, her hair flowing
loosely, and stood before us.</p>

<p>Cutting looked directly at her, and in her eyes
there was a light of questioning. &#8220;I must leave
you, Molly,&#8221; he said. Still looking at him in that
singular way, she asked: &#8220;For how long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not in my power to say. These men are
police officers. They knew me from the east.
They want me to go down to the jail with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be there long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could help myself, I would not go at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, with a nervous laugh. &#8220;I understand.
Something possibly about that poor boy
in your employ and that robbery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan&#8217;s black eyes were studying the woman
intently; Leslie was watching Cutting. Both, I
could see, were puzzled. Even I, with my duller
perceptions, was sensible that there was some subtle
undercurrent in this conversation; something cryptic
that I could not solve.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will need your hat,&#8221; she said, and turned to
the hat rack in the rear of the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Chief,&#8221; said Cutting, in an aside,
arising, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got me. Please don&#8217;t make any
scene before her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>She returned with the hat. He fumbled with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me,&#8221; he said. She did so; left his arms,
but came back to them, a gush of tears starting as she
clung to him in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go,&#8221; he said, faintly, his voice breaking. She
turned and stumbled for the stairs. A quick look
flashed from Lanagan to the Chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;One minute, madam,&#8221; said Leslie, sternly.
&#8220;You had better come along, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>No!</i>&#8221; cried Cutting. &#8220;Never, Chief, as you
are a man! Never in a million years! She has
never known of my work out here; she knew me
before Moyomemsing; she stuck by me during it all;
she married me and we came out here. She knows
nothing; nothing. She may have suspected, but she
knew nothing. The old call claimed me, going
through those houses making estimates on cleaning;
why, it&#8217;s a disease, that&#8217;s all, Chief! I got pressed
for money. I undertook too much in my business.
I couldn&#8217;t handle it. I had notes to meet. I just
fell naturally back to the old easy way. That&#8217;s all.
Just went back to it because that&#8217;s the way I was
born, I suppose; crooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph. Where did you send the stuff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;East. Except the Robbins. Needed money
bad, didn&#8217;t want to take a chance handling it here, so
I tried the message. What Harrigan didn&#8217;t get is
down at the office in the safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We suspected that,&#8221; said Leslie. &#8220;How long
has Harrigan been cutting with you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, well, don&#8217;t ask me that. Some time. He&#8217;s
a wolf. I am a crook, but he&#8217;s got me lashed to
the mast. The kid stuff was none of mine. I did
lose one ring at the office. The boy found it. He
got scared and contradicted himself. Harrigan
framed the other thing about the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s pretty nearly an even break,&#8221; said
Leslie. He stepped forward to put on the wrist
nippers. As he did so Cutting raised his hat to his
head; his hand, coming down, stopped for a fraction
of a second at his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better this,&#8221; he said, rapidly, backing away, &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t go back. I&#8217;m a pretty old man, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though he had been shot through the heart he
dropped in a heap. Lanagan leaped for him. The
Chief bent over him. They arose together. Lanagan
picked up the hat and turned back the sweat
band. Inside was a little envelope, pasted to the
felt. It was half filled with white powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cyanide,&#8221; said Lanagan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the passing of the Swallow.</p>

<p>Lanagan, in his search for similar conditions in
the ten burglaries found but one: that Cutting had
personally visited each house to make the estimates
of cost. That fact, coupled with the ring found at
his establishment, convinced Lanagan that he and
he alone was the man. Cutting worked four machines,
each with its separate crew, and no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
employee had worked in more than three out of the
ten houses.</p>

<p>Anxious to keep track of Cutting after his theory
began to impress him, he had learned that he was at
the theatre. He had picked him up after the show,
trailed him to a café, followed him in a taxicab as he
took his wife home, and kept at his tail lights when
he returned after one o&#8217;clock to discharge the machine
and walk to a saloon well south of Market
Street where he had met Harrigan. That was Lanagan&#8217;s
first definite information that Harrigan and
Cutting were involved.</p>

<p>Cutting and Harrigan had separated, Lanagan
following Cutting to his establishment. He remained
there some time, busied about his safe, and
had then apparently gone directly home.</p>

<p>It was then that Lanagan picked me up.</p>

<p>Harrigan, of course, was the man who had passed
through the alley. He then had gone on out to Cutting&#8217;s
house, for a final distribution of the spoils,
Cutting having evidently taken Harrigan&#8217;s share
from the safe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late that same afternoon Lanagan sat in Leslie&#8217;s
office with Robbins, who had just received his
jewelry. Robbins drew out his check book.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will permit me?&#8221; he said, to Lanagan.
He had filled in &#8220;$250.&#8221; &#8220;How do you spell your
name?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>Lanagan laughed. &#8220;Make it out to the Adams
Piano Company,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Robbins looked politely inquisitive, but asked no
questions. He wrote in the name. But Leslie was
not so polite.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the name of Sam Hill are you going to
do with a piano?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, myself. I wouldn&#8217;t take it any more
than I would take the money. You know that.
But there is a girl I know who can use that piano
and use it to very good advantage. And what&#8217;s
more, she&#8217;s entitled to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up the check and carefully folded it,
placing it in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over now and pick out the best piano
the money will buy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m going to
send it, with the compliments of Mr. Robbins, Chief
Leslie and Jack Lanagan to a little home at 211
Clementina Street, Miss Ward is the name.&#8221;</p>

OUT OF THE DEPTHS</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Stockslager case will be recalled immediately
upon the Pacific Coast as a crime of
some years ago marked by the peculiar atrocity of
the circumstances. Aged Mrs. Stockslager, living
in a small cottage at the extreme northern end of
Thirty-third Avenue&mdash;in those days a region
sparsely settled and visited chiefly by picknickers
bound for Baker&#8217;s Beach&mdash;was found one Sunday
morning literally hacked to pieces.</p>

<p>From the location of portions of the dismembered
body it was apparent that the author had planned to
carry the evidences of the crime away and sink them
in the waters of the ocean, which tumbled and rolled
on the rocks at the base of the steep cliff that
marked the extremity of Thirty-third Avenue. A
potato sack, with the torso, was found near the rear
door to the cottage, indicating that whoever had
committed the deed had probably been interrupted
while carrying the remains to the bay; and had then
fled.</p>

<p>A kitchen butcher knife was the weapon used.
Robbery was evidently the motive, for the hut had
been ransacked thoroughly, such poor and mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
trinkets as the recluse was known to possess having
been taken.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stockslager did a small business in sandwiches,
pop corn and soda water with the picknickers.
The rumours of a miser&#8217;s hoard that usually
attached to such as she had long been current. But
whether the slayer or slayers realised a profit in
money could not be determined as there was no one
who could be found sufficiently familiar with her
life to say whether she did or did not have a store
of money on the premises.</p>

<p>Such were the general facts which Sampson, city
editor of the <i>Enquirer</i>, skeletonised tersely to Lanagan
as that police reporter of superior talents reported
for duty after a lapse of more than ordinary
duration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hop to it, Jack,&#8221; added Sampson. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
had your salary for two weeks. Show your appreciation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those were the days before automobiles might
be requisitioned&mdash;occasionally&mdash;for big assignments,
and Lanagan, taking the steam line that in
those days twisted around the ocean shore, was considerably
later than the coroner&#8217;s deputies, who had
already discharged their functions and now were
engaged in making an impromptu meal upon the
old woman&#8217;s supply of sandwiches, the only loot
available.</p>

<p>Phillips and Castle, special duty men from the
Golden Gate Park police station, were also on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
scene. The &#8220;upper office&#8221; at headquarters is recruited&mdash;where
it is not recruited by politics or
favouritism&mdash;by these active young officers on
special duty at the outside stations, and Lanagan
knew that this particular brace of plain-clothes men
were hardworking and ambitious and without the
&#8220;strings&#8221; that many times bring the ablest of upper
office men a trifle too considerately into touch
with the outlaw clans.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make of it, Phillips?&#8221; asked Lanagan,
as the officer placed his note-book in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t call it a suicide, exactly,&#8221; replied
Phillips, offishly.</p>

<p>Lanagan laughed. &#8220;No?&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t put it past you to call it natural causes,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phillips flushed to the base of his thick neck but
held himself from answering. He knew Lanagan
by reputation and did not care to match wits with
him. Lanagan worked with most of the &#8220;upper
office&#8221; men on intimate terms, but found it occasionally
necessary to put a &#8220;crimp&#8221; in the arrogance,
or ignorance, of the outside station officers,
who do not come into contact with newspaper men
as frequently as the down town men and at times
elect to affect the same impartiality with which they
treat ordinary persons. Such Lanagan took pride in
bringing to a proper appreciation of the honourable
place occupied by the brothers of the Tribe.</p>

<p>Lanagan ignored the two detectives and gave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
attention to the coroner&#8217;s deputies, the cottage and
outskirts, and the contents of the wicker basket.
Before the next train arrived, bringing a dozen reporters
and camera men from the other papers, and
myself, Lanagan had finished his investigations. I
found him seated on a salt grass hummock, smoking
and gazing absently up and down the ragged, rocky
shore line. The surf was tumbling heavily although
a few hundred yards out the sea was an undulating
swell of greenish beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some fine day,&#8221; was his greeting. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take
a stroll down.&#8221;</p>

<p>We made our way down the cliff to the rocks at
the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagination is oftentimes a great thing in solving
crime,&#8221; he remarked, as he poised himself perilously
on a slippery rock and relit his cigar. &#8220;That
and the &#8216;take a chance&#8217; instinct. Call it a hunch,
bull-luck, accident, or as one great French detective
said, &#8216;le grand hasard.&#8217; Beautiful picture, is it
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed toward the Heads, where a Pacific
Mail steamship was just putting her pilot down the
side. She made a fine picture in truth, with her
clean, lithe lines and her smoke blowing back like
the wind-blown tresses of a girl.</p>

<p>We strolled along the intermittent stretches of
sandy beach or clambered over the rocks and it
finally struck me that Lanagan&#8217;s ferret eyes were not
at all absent-minded or entirely busied with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
natural beauties of the scene, but that he was examining
closely every square inch of the ground we
travelled; and the waters as we passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phillips is rather cagey,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
have to be taught his place. He&#8217;s a good officer,
though; and Leslie has his eye on him. We must
look out for that chap. He not only has good legs,
a prime requisite of a detective or a reporter, but
he has a head that really works once in a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down finally under the shelter of a great
rock and motioned me to do likewise. Then he
pulled from his pocket, carefully tucked away, a
V-shaped piece of paper written over with Chinese
characters. The corner that made the apex of the
V was crinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a piece of a Chinese newspaper,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really! You would do credit to Phillips.
<i>Examine</i> it this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried again, but could make nothing of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look.&#8221;</p>

<p>He uncrumpled the slight crinkling at the apex
and a tiny bit of red paper was exposed. I was
ashamed of my own lack of observation; but just
as puzzled as before and said so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say,&#8221; said Lanagan, &#8220;that this paper
with the Chinese characters was a piece of wrapping
paper; that someone tore it from a package
with his finger nails and that a portion of the red
wrapper of the package itself, came off in his finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
nails. See?&#8221; He crumpled it up and sure enough
it fitted neatly into the space under his finger nail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked, vaguely. Then I had an inspiration.
The Chinese burial ground was only an
eighth of a mile away. Lanagan obviously had
some theory connecting Chinese with the crime, the
bit of paper evidently having dropped from a
Chinaman&#8217;s blouse. I told him so. He laughed
immoderately but indulgently and carefully put the
bit of paper away in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a stem-winder when it comes to writing
fancy leads for my police stories,&#8221; he said, still
chuckling, &#8220;but I guess I&#8217;ll have to give up for
keeps trying to make a detective out of you. I
have shown you in perspective as it were, during the
past twenty minutes, the solution of this entire
crime&mdash;if my theory is not altogether wrong&mdash;and
you can&#8217;t see it. Let&#8217;s get busy. Your legs
can at least be of service to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to stick around here for a couple
of hours. Tackle everybody in sight for a knowledge
of Mrs. Stockslager; how long she has been
out here, her past, who her family are if any, who
her visitors have been; if she had any particular
idiosyncrasies or hobbies. Take in all the houses
within a radius of a mile&mdash;there are only four or
five&mdash;and try to get some kind of a line on her.
Don&#8217;t overlook the small boy. In out-of-the-way
regions like this he is the pioneer of civilisation and
you may tumble on to more through some roving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
urchin than all the grown-ups in the county. I
will leave instructions at the office where to meet
me later. I anticipate lively entertainment ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we got back to the cottage the coroner&#8217;s
deputies had gone, as had Phillips and Castle.
Camera men were taking the house from many
angles; artists were busy sketching the interior&mdash;that
was the heyday of &#8220;yellow journalism&#8221;&mdash;marking
the &#8220;spot&#8221; with the old familiar cross.
Reporters were still cluttering around. A crowd
of morbid persons, attracted out of the very sky
like vultures, were already gathered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you&#8217;ve got it all cleared?&#8221; remarked
Bradley of the <i>Times</i> to Lanagan. He was Lanagan&#8217;s
nearest approach to a rival as a police reporter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear as print can make it,&#8221; replied Lanagan as
he turned for the train.</p>

<p>He ran for the car, leaving Bradley secretly uneasy.
He had a wholesome regard for Lanagan
and knew that he was of few words and not given
to wasting them. I slipped the rest of the newspaper
men and tramped the sandhills &#8220;covering&#8221;
all the houses, &#8220;buzzing&#8221; an occasional small boy.
The best I could get for two hours&#8217; hard work&mdash;and
the first &#8220;tip&#8221; came from an unwashed, sling-shooting
young American&mdash;was a vague story that
no one could substantiate, that Mrs. Stockslager
had a worthless son who infrequently visited her
for money. I hugged this information close until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
I could see Lanagan. It so happened he ordered
me to keep it quiet for that day, giving no reasons.</p>

<p>I was chagrined the next morning to awaken and
find that Bradley had the same piece of information
and had &#8220;flashed&#8221; it on the front page for an exclusive
double-leaded feature to his story.</p>

<p>The search then turned to the son. He could be
traced to within six or seven months of the murder.
I had to lumber along as best I could in handling
the story without Lanagan&#8217;s assistance. The stories
in all of the papers became monotonously uniform.
On the third day the interest was thinning. There
had not been a single new fact discovered; nor, so
far as the <i>Enquirer</i> was concerned, had there been
a word from Lanagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have something,&#8221; Sampson said to me
irritably on the third day. &#8220;But take a flier through
his hangouts on the chance that he might have
gone off again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t Lanagan with a
story on,&#8221; I said. &#8220;He does his drinking when the
story is turned in.&#8221; Nevertheless I took a quick
skirmish to Connor&#8217;s, Fogarty&#8217;s and &#8220;Red&#8221;
Murphy&#8217;s; looked up &#8220;Kid&#8221; Monahan and some
of Lanagan&#8217;s intimates in the upper office. I could
find no trace of him.</p>

<p>Toward evening I dropped back to the <i>Enquirer</i>
after a final round-up of the ends of the story at
police headquarters, and there Lanagan sat with
his heels on Sampson&#8217;s desk, with that pulseless individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
shooting questions at him with the speed
and precision of an automatic revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve given you all I am free to give just now,&#8221;
said Lanagan, shutting down on the questioning.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a good enough scoop to hold the story
for to-morrow. Let me handle the rest in my own
way, will you?&#8221; He was nettled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so
didactic. Do you think I&#8217;ve been spending the last
three days with a dry nurse?&#8221; He was the only
man on the <i>Enquirer</i> who could take that tone with
Sampson and hold his job.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I know you&#8217;ve been on your toes hard,
Jack, and I appreciate it. Only the news-call gets
the best of me and this story has us all on edge,&#8221;
replied Sampson.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not to go near the prison,&#8221; continued
Lanagan. &#8220;I need Norton to-night. Let Martin
write the story from here. Stockslager is absolutely
out of it. He has been a trusty at the city
prison for about six months, which clears him up.
Name he goes under is &#8216;Swede&#8217; Stockley. The
police have known it all along but they have kept it
dark for certain reasons which I am not at liberty
now to state.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lend me that nice, new mackintosh of yours,
Sampson. It&#8217;s raining like blazes and the enthusiastic
Mr. Norton and myself will have a hard stand
to-night. Take your raincoat, Norton. We are
going out looking for ghosts around the Stockslager
cottage. There&#8217;s a real ghost of the old lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
out there and I&#8217;ve wanted for a long time to have
a run-in with a genuine spook. She was seen on
the cliff last night as the train stopped. McCluskey,
the conductor, thought he heard a sort of moaning.
He&#8217;s a pretty nervy chap and the moans, coming
it seemed from the hut, didn&#8217;t scare him much.
He walked over that way and silhouetted at the edge
of the cliff he swears he saw the old lady herself.
It was too much even for McCluskey and he ran
back to the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;He and the engineer, Roberts, went back with
a couple of crowbars although he didn&#8217;t say what
good crowbars would do in tackling a bonafide
ghost. They just got one glimpse of the thing and
it disappeared and they both swear it couldn&#8217;t have
had time to get any place before they reached the
scene. It was a fairly clear night, during a break
in the storm, and they wasted five minutes and then
went back to their train.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was out there to-day and McCluskey told me
the yarn. They&#8217;ve kept it quiet around the car
barn for fear of being ridiculed. I have them
pledged to secrecy. Don&#8217;t use that angle of the
story to-morrow, though, as I want to do some
ghost hunting before the whole town hears about
it and flocks out there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Norrie. Got your gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>That ghost talk gave me all sorts of forebodings.
With a black night ahead and a driving rain, ghost
hunting on the scene of the murder, in an environment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
sufficiently forbidding on a wintry night in
any event, failed to stir me to any particular height
of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire ahead,&#8221; said Sampson, with one of his
mirthless grins. But he was sitting comfortably in
a steam-heated office.</p>

<p>It was nine o&#8217;clock when we boarded the steam
cars at the old Central Avenue terminal. McCluskey
was a solid-jawed, sensible, self-reliant looking
chap. It puzzled me. A sober, steady man like
that must have seen something very convincing before
sponsoring talk of ghosts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghost hunting?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Lanagan. &#8220;Good feature story,
this ghost stuff. Keep it quiet for a day or two
longer, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ll be on the watch for the <i>Enquirer</i>
to see about it. Looked for it to-night, but didn&#8217;t
see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slowed down for us about an eighth of a mile
from the Thirty-third Avenue stop and we dropped
off into a bitter rain.</p>

<p>That rain would have quenched the tail fires of
hell.</p>

<p>We struggled on, heads down. There was no
use in trying to talk and I knew Lanagan would take
his own time about giving me any information.
We suddenly pulled stiffly up against two bulky,
raincoated figures. A dark lantern flashed, first in
my face, then in Lanagan&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; It was Lanagan&#8217;s ready voice,
pitched a trifle high on account of the beating rain.
&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t Messrs. Phillips and Castle! Walking
to reduce weight, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you fellows doing out here?&#8221; asked
Phillips, gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Phillips, seeing that it&#8217;s you, I&#8217;ll tell you:
It&#8217;s none of your business. Maybe we&#8217;re going to
swim to the Farallones. Do you understand me
perfectly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? We&#8217;ll see. And I don&#8217;t know
whether we want you snuffing around here or not,&#8221;
replied Phillips. He was a choleric man, was Phillips,
with a neck too thick even for a policeman. I
thought for a moment Lanagan would have us both
ordered back, but he only laughed, in that mocking,
Machiavelian laugh of his that could rasp like a file
on a sore tooth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your mood fits the weather,
Phillips; very disagreeable. I am not concerned
with your wants. I&#8217;m going to snuff to my heart&#8217;s
content. Now please step off the right of way and
permit us to pass. We are both citizens of this
great and glorious city that overpays you most disgracefully
in proportion to your attainments; and
as such citizens our powers and privileges on the
county domain are precisely as full and complete as
yours. Phillips, you&#8217;ll never do. No policeman
ever succeeds who begins by antagonising newspaper
men. I&#8217;m telling you, you won&#8217;t do. Step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
aside, please. We want to go on and we don&#8217;t
purpose to walk around you to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment things looked ugly, with Phillips
standing fast. Castle took him by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Tom, you&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; he said, and the
two officers stepped to one side and we passed on,
with Lanagan chuckling aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghost hunting is becoming a regular fad,&#8221; he
said finally. &#8220;And I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find
a few more hunters scattered around. We will let
Phillips and Castle pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stepped quickly to one side and sank down
behind a hillock of very wet and very cold sand.
Lanagan was correct. The two detectives had
turned and followed us. They went on ahead, having
missed us.</p>

<p>It was shivery. Here were four men, two trailing
two others who assumed they were the trailers;
and all bound for a murder house on a black night
to hunt ghosts: for it was safe to assume that in
some fashion Phillips and Castle had heard the
ghost episode. Did we but know it at the time,
we were in turn being trailed by two keen eyed,
storm-coated men, each of whom kept a ready hand
in his overcoat pocket.</p>

<p>For, as Phillips and Castle disappeared on ahead
and we were just stepping back to the railroad
tracks from our place of concealment, Lanagan suddenly
bore back and dropped. I followed suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;More ghost hunters,&#8221; he whispered in my ear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
pointing. Two blurred, indistinct figures passed
along the right of way. It was awesome. But
Lanagan gave me no time for questions. Stooping
low, threshing softly through the dripping salt
grass, in and out among the sand dunes, we worked
our way gradually toward the cliffs along the ocean.
The coat fairly well protected my body, but my
shoes were soaked and I was drenched with the
cold, numbing rain to my knees.</p>

<p>In a position I should judge about twenty yards
from the point where the path from the Stockslager
path led over the cliff to the rocks below, we
crouched against a hummock. The ocean roared
beneath us and the white froth of the breakers,
tumbling on the rocks, could be faintly seen. Each
time it would flash into the corner of my eye, I
thought it was ghost time. I don&#8217;t believe in ghosts,
of course; but, under such circumstances, one can&#8217;t
help wondering a little bit. From behind us, as we
lay there, once, twice, thrice, four times we heard
the toot, toot of the train; and I knew that we had
lain there for two mortal hours, because the train
made hourly round trips.</p>

<p>I thought of Sampson and his snug office and his
snug salary; and I compared myself, taking the
chances of anything from a pistol ball to pneumonia
for my thirty dollars a week. I concluded to quit
the business at the end of this scrape. But I always
determined to do that under such circumstances.
So does every newspaper man; and they always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
show up for work the next day. Were we not at
least potential paranoiacs we wouldn&#8217;t be newspaper
men. Certainly otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t do the
things we do for the pay we get. Regarding newspaper
photographers, there is no question. They
are all crazy; except one.</p>

<p>We had drunk the last drop from the healthy
flask apiece we had brought and I was settling back
in soggy misery for more suffering, my eyes so
blurred with watching and staring that I could see
slinking forms in fancy every place I turned, when
Lanagan&#8217;s lean hand clutched my leg. He had
taken a position lower and nearer the path than I
and could get a dim perspective of the edge of the
cliff just where the path descended.</p>

<p>I peered ahead. Faintly I could see a single figure,
outlined in blurred relief and then it disappeared,
apparently into thin air. Whether it was
man or woman I could not have told. That it disappeared
before my eyes I knew.</p>

<p>It gave one a creepy feeling. I was about to
speak to Lanagan but his warning pressure was still
on my calf. Probably thirty minutes passed, or it
may have been only three. Another figure came
into view; and then another, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Then I realised that the first figure had simply
slipped down the path and out of sight. I wondered
if something of the sort hadn&#8217;t happened when
McCluskey was ghost hunting.</p>

<p>Still Lanagan held that vice-like clutch on me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Another prolonged interval. Two more figures
bulked into view and disappeared. Many more
minutes passed and Lanagan said no word. The
wind during the hours had died away, but the rain
continued, pelting now straight down. Lanagan&#8217;s
hand finally loosened itself from my leg. He
pointed over the ocean toward the intermittent
flashes of the lighthouse at Land&#8217;s End. Between
the Land&#8217;s End and Fort Point lights could be seen&mdash;the
lights of a vessel.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a day overdue on account of the storm,&#8221;
Lanagan shot up at me. &#8220;She&#8217;s heading through
the Golden Gate now. We&#8217;ll have some fun shortly,
I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He straightened up and stretched himself and I
did likewise, threshing my arms to start the blood
into circulation. I was cold, cramped and grouchy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; I said impatiently, &#8220;cut out this mystery
stuff and give me the facts. You&#8217;ve got me neck
and neck with pneumonia now. Kick through with
this story, whatever it is, or I&#8217;m going to tear down
that cliff after those fellows and start something if
only to keep warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course he only laughed. The man must have
been made of chilled steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, Norrie. Think of the ten cents&#8217; carfare
you can charge up on this assignment. That ought
to be some compensation, that and the glory of the
thing, even if you do get sciatica or lumbago or some
other old woman&#8217;s complaint. Norrie, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
you make me weary. Here I&#8217;m staging one of the
finest climaxes you have ever participated in. I
have adopted a true Shakespearean method of suiting
the natural surroundings to the action. It&#8217;s
rather an epic situation, in my opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that liner&mdash;it was the Mail boat <i>Hongkong</i>&mdash;has
finally passed inside the gate. Any
minute something may happen, and I pick you out
of the entire staff to be here when it does happen;
here in an elemental atmosphere where human lives
may be snuffed out as we snuffed out the contents of
those flasks, and still you&#8217;re not satisfied. It&#8217;s a big,
vital, gripping situation. Where&#8217;s your imagination?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hell. You&#8217;re drunk. Let&#8217;s chase down
after those men. Let&#8217;s do something to start things,
whatever they may be. I&#8217;m cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan was genuinely put out with me. Later
I knew why. He had been hanging around those
bleak cliffs for two nights and skulking in the sand
dunes for two days watching the Stockslager hut.
No wonder I was a &#8220;quitter&#8221; by comparison. He
whirled on me and I saw his eyes flashing with that
curious light that I had seen in them on rare occasions
when he was thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You either quit whining or beat it back to
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he had struck me in the face it couldn&#8217;t have
affected me differently, such was the magnetism of
that remarkable man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Jack. I didn&#8217;t mean to
rough you,&#8221; I said, and he was his natural self in a
moment, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Forget it. Let&#8217;s take a peek over
the cliff.&#8221; We crawled to the edge of the path.
Lanagan was ahead. He was on his feet with a
leap the instant he struck the ledge, and I up beside
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ha!</i>&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;<i>They&#8217;re at it! Now we&#8217;ll
see! Now we&#8217;ll see! Le grand hasard!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Far down below I saw a half a dozen flares in the
darkness; smattered, smeared flares of yellowish
light and then all was blackness again. There came
no report from weapons, the roaring of the surf
drowning that. More by instinct than anything
else to be on the scene of action, I made a quick step
toward the path. Lanagan&#8217;s hand was on my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said, curtly. &#8220;This is no funeral of
ours. Wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knelt down, arching his hands around his
eyes and peering long and intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Revenue officers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t monkey
with them. Haven&#8217;t got them on my staff like
Leslie and his men. They&#8217;ll be up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Revenue officers! A light began to dawn upon
me.</p>

<p>The toot, toot of the engine came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beat it, Norrie! Hold that train,&#8221; ordered
Lanagan. &#8220;There may be some wounded here to
rush to town. Quick!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i295.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;On the floor they placed the figure they bore, a stalwart figure of a man.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>I was already off on the run past the Stockslager
hut to the little platform where the train stopped.
It was some distance away around the curve. As I
stood there, with the rain pattering a monotonous
tattoo on the planking, there came a sudden groan,
a drawn-out, rasping groan, and I whirled toward
the house; my body one quiver of gooseflesh. It
came again, from up toward the roof; and as it came
there was a breathing of light wind across my face.
I laughed aloud; but nervously. Another light
puff of wind, another long-drawn groan&mdash;loose
shingles, or a loose piece of clapboarding, giving, evidently,
just the slightest against a nail. The other
end of the ghost mystery was cleared.</p>

<p>The train pulled in. I told McCluskey there had
been a shooting, and to hold the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t back her in. We&#8217;ll run out to the first
switch!&#8221; he cried, as he jumped into the cab with
the engineer.</p>

<p>I ran back to find four men bearing a form between
them. Lanagan was alongside the leader of
the four, talking swiftly. They kicked in the door
of the hut and made a light. On the floor, littered
just as it had been littered the Sunday morning of
the murder discovery, they placed the figure they
bore, a stalwart figure of a man. A leg and an arm,
I could see, were useless. They felt of his arm and
leg and he never winced, staring straight at the ceiling.
They ripped away his oilskin coat, his over-shirt
and undershirt. He had a bullet just over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
heart, a deep wound and one that bled inwardly, for
no blood oozed out.</p>

<p>Two of the four men had deposited on the floor
bulky bundles wrapped in rubber, around which
double pairs of life preservers were strapped.</p>

<p>He who seemed to be the leader of the four
(&#8220;Marshall, chief revenue inspector,&#8221; Lanagan
whispered to me), took the man&#8217;s pulse after the
examination was ended. No one had spoken. In
the faces of all, as far as I could detect in the murky
light of the smoky chimney of an oil lamp, was a
set, grim look; not the look that officers usually wear
when there has been a killing or a successful capture
in a crime.</p>

<p>Marshall straightened up. He said, solemnly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I think you are going. What have you
got to say? Any message?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Jim,&#8221; said the man on the floor, weakly.
&#8220;You got me right. I went into the thing with my
eyes open. Only don&#8217;t ask me to squeal on the
others. I got what I deserved, I guess. I&#8217;ve
brought shame to the service and I&#8217;m ready to pass.
Thank God, thank God,&#8221; he burst out with sudden
choking, &#8220;the wife is not here&mdash;passed out last
year, you know; and there never were any kiddies.
No one to suffer but you boys that I&#8217;ve disgraced.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tear rolled from his eyes to the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I say a word to him, Marshall?&#8221; It
was Lanagan who spoke. The other men had
bowed their heads. On one or two faces I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
see a tear, for all the wetness that the rain had left
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enright,&#8221; said Lanagan, kneeling down beside
the stricken man, &#8220;you know you are passing.
Make a clean breast. <i>Who killed Mrs. Stockslager?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes closed and he seemed to shrink as though
trying to hug the floor he was lying upon.
&#8220;Whisky!&#8221; came Lanagan&#8217;s sharp whisper. Unconsciously
he was taking command of the situation,
asserting his natural leadership as he always
did in tense moments. Marshall passed him a
pocket flask and he forced a sip to Enright&#8217;s lips,
holding his head up with his left arm. The eyes
opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I did.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God, Billy! No, no! Not that, not
that!&#8221; It was Marshall. He broke down and
sobbed like a boy. Twenty-five years he had been
in the federal blue with Billy Enright, one in the
revenue, the other in the customs service.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;<i>I did!</i> Jim, get me a priest! Don&#8217;t let
me die like this! For old time&#8217;s sake, Jim!&#8221;</p>

<p>The train was whistling on its return.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking you right in,&#8221; said Lanagan,
soothingly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a priest for you. Why
did you kill her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Enright motioned for the flask with his free arm.
Lanagan gave him a long pull. For a time at least
his voice was stronger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>&#8220;She was threatening to tip off the gang. She
used to work with us. She was well paid. She
didn&#8217;t know I was in the service. She found it out
some way. I came out one day to talk over with
her about her threats. I&#8217;d been drinking, worrying
over fear of exposure. She wouldn&#8217;t listen to
reason. She was a wolf. She goaded me crazy, I
guess. She taunted me about being a traitor to
the country I served. Well, I lost my head. I
grabbed the butcher knife and killed her. So help
me God as I am about to die, that&#8217;s the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes closed for a space, and then he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I stuck a few things in my pockets to make it
look like robbery. Then I started to cut up the
body to pack it in a sack and bury it or drop it off
the cliff. I weakened and dropped it outside the
door and ran. It was dark but I ran for miles
around over the sandhills and it seemed she was
always right after me. It was awful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got my wits back later. I saw the police and
the papers were after the son. I felt easier. There
was a big shipment coming in on the <i>Hongkong</i>&mdash;$40,000
all told. No one would come out here and
take a chance landing it. Afraid the police were
watching the house. I volunteered. I figured if
any one saw me nosing around I could give them
the inspector talk. I hung around last night but
the ship was held away out on account of the storm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
I had to come out&mdash;again&mdash;to-night&mdash;that&#8217;s all,
boys&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The door flung open and through it came Phillips
and Castle. McCluskey and Roberts followed.
The train had stopped unnoticed, so tense was the
interest within the hut in the dying man&#8217;s recital.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, take him up,&#8221; said Lanagan. They
stooped to lift him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, what&#8217;s all this?&#8221; It was Phillips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand aside!&#8221; came Marshall&#8217;s blunt command.
It was obeyed. Enright&#8217;s eyes had closed. He was
made as comfortable as possible with cushions on
the train, as that ancient rattle-trap strained and
tugged to make the greatest speed of its history.
Enright&#8217;s eyes did not open on the trip in.</p>

<p>They never opened again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lanagan filled in for me the details of the story.
The bit of red paper, crinkled inside the paper with
the Chinese characters, meant but one thing: opium.
Here was where his wide acquaintance with the underworld
and Chinatown, the customs service and
the water front, aided him.</p>

<p>Puzzling over the presence of an opium wrapping
in that isolated hut Lanagan had seated himself upon
the salt grass hummock to smoke. Into his field of
vision steamed the Pacific Mail liner&mdash;and his
&#8220;hunch&#8221; came with it. His examination of the
shore followed to locate a cove that would give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
safe place to float the opium to land from a launch
or white hall boat by day or night. Such a cove he
had found, where the waters for a sixteenth of a
mile deposited their driftwood. His theory was
complete. The hut was a smuggler&#8217;s runway; the
woman was in the ring and for a breach of faith
had been slain, an attempt being made to have it
appear she was slain by robbers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That Marshall and his men had been preparing to
close in on the gang that made the cabin their rendezvous
Lanagan did not know until the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I found the whole map out here sprinkled
with them. Recognised Marshall, who nearly
tumbled over me; but he probably figured I was one
of his men, and said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was funny. McCluskey and Roberts chasing
ghosts with myself and four revenue officers as the
audience. I nearly laughed when McCluskey told
me the story this morning. They didn&#8217;t come
within fifteen yards of the edge of the cliff, either,
although they said they did.</p>

<p>&#8220;The weather man told me to-day the storm
would blow over by evening and I figured the <i>Hongkong</i>
would be making port and the ring would
attempt to land their stuff; every liner has been
bringing it in. I came out last night on the chance
she might try to make port.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one suspected Enright.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>It was a quarter to one o&#8217;clock when the train
pulled into the depot. Marshall turned the body
over to Phillips and Castle with a terse resume of
the facts and then took his men and his bundles of
opium and disappeared. They laid Enright out on
a bench to await the coroner&#8217;s deputies.</p>

<p>Phillips came over to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I acted kind of stiff,&#8221; he said, in awkward
apology. &#8220;But I want to hand it to you.
You scored on us strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lanagan put out his hand. The detective took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never make any mistake treating newspaper
men right, Phillips. Just do this much for us
now, will you? Hold off thirty minutes before you
telephone the morgue. That will keep the story
exclusively for the <i>Enquirer</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; said Phillips.</p>

<p>And he did; which may seem to the layman a little
thing, but to the newspaper man a detail of vast importance;
because it enabled Lanagan, sending the
story to the office by telephone, to score once again
in sensational manner over his contemporaries, the
<i>Times</i> and the <i>Herald</i>.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
