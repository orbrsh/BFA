    <div>A FAMILY DISCUSSION</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ellen settled herself on the most uncomfortable
chair in the room for the simple reason that it was
the only one left her, the others being occupied by
her elders, relatives of various sorts. She pulled down
her skimpy black skirt over the length of rusty-looking
stockings which covered her long legs, and gave herself
up to a survey of the articles in the room. There
were so many little gimcracks that Ellen considered
she could entertain herself by looking at them while
the others talked and talked. She was not interested
in the conversation at first, but suddenly she withdrew
her gaze from a group of wax flowers and fruit under
glass, and sat up very straight. They were talking
about her!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Being a bachelor whose housekeeper would leave
if a child were foisted upon her care, I couldn’t consider
taking her, housekeepers not growing upon every
bush these days,” said Mr. Josiah Crump, a bald-headed
pot-bellied old gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen pictured a bush with housekeepers dangling
from it, and wondered what such might be called.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this fancy left her when Mr. Crump continued,
“I always liked Rosanne and haven’t a thing against
her daughter, but I never cared much for that artist
husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gerald North was a dear, a perfect dear,” spoke up
pretty Mrs. Lauretta Barton; “I always liked him
and so did Bobby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No business sense; impractical,” Mr. Crump differed
with her. “No man has any right to go off to
war and get killed, leaving his family unprovided for;
it makes it very awkward for them, and furnishes an
unpleasant subject for the relatives to contemplate. I
don’t believe in having unpleasant subjects brought up
when they might be avoided.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like unpleasant subjects myself,” sighed
Mrs. Barton, “but they have to be faced when they are
thrust upon you. I wish I could advise, or, indeed,
assume the responsibility of the child myself, but in my
delicate state of health it would be impossible; it would
be entirely too great a task.”</p>

<p class='c009'> “Delicate fiddlesticks!”  broke in Miss Orinda
Crump.  “What you need, Lauretta, is some vital
interest to take you out of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'> “If only Bobby were living,” murmured Mrs. Barton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which he isn’t,” pursued Miss Orinda, “and it
doesn’t do you any good to brood over your loss, or to
magnify every little ache and pain; you’ll end in a
sanitarium.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I do suffer; you don’t know,” complained
Mrs. Barton plaintively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From lack of exercise, rich food, and nothing to
think of but your own self,” continued Miss Orinda.
“If you had to hustle for your bread and butter, and
turned your thoughts out instead of in, you’d find life
more interesting; but when your hardest exercise is
cutting off coupons, and your chief interest is in germs,
vitamines, and X-rays, what can you expect? As I
see it, it’s up to you to adopt Ellen. Don’t you think
so, Uncle Jo?”</p>

<p class='c009'> “H’m, well, each must be his own judge in such
matters,” replied Mr. Crump, leaning back in his chair
and placing the tips of his fingers together. “I believe
 in freedom of thought, in——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do shut up, Jo,” said his sister, Mrs. Ed.
Shirley, a stout, comfortable, well-dressed woman.
“Once you get off on one of your harangues there
will be no stopping you. Of course every one knows
that, with my big family, I couldn’t be expected to
take the girl. It is as much as I can do to manage
my own brood, so count me out, Orinda.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why you all constitute me chairman of
this meeting,” retorted Miss Orinda. “If age has any
prerogative, it isn’t up to me to preside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it’s your house, and you got us here,” returned
Mrs. Shirley.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To read you the letters from Dr. Markham and
Mr. Barstow, that you might understand how imperative
it is that Ellen should be provided for at
once. You all have your own cars, so it was no effort
for you to get here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the matter with her Uncle Leonard?
Why isn’t he here? He is nearer of kin than we are,
and has no children,” Mrs. Shirley went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has sea duty for two years, and I don’t know
where he is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there’s his wife.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is with her people in California. She will
stay till he gets back, and anyway——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are her father’s people? Why don’t they
come forward?” Mr. Crump again came into the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His parents are dead, and he was an only child.
If he had any near relatives, we do not know where
they are.”</p>

<p class='c009'> “Humph! I understand. Well, as far as I can
see we’d better put the girl in some good institution;
there are plenty of them. What with taxes and the
high cost of living it isn’t up to any of us to increase
our expenses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen smothered a little cry of dismay and clenched
her hands. An institution! She choked back her
tears. She must be brave. She must not let them see.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment’s complete silence. Mr. Crump
sat with his hands clasped over his ample front, his
eyes fixed on the ceiling, and an expression which said,
“The oracle has spoken.” Mrs. Shirley looked across
with a satisfied smile at Mrs. Barton, who lifted her
hands and let them fall helplessly into her lap, intimating
 that there was nothing further to be said. Miss
Orinda alone looked at Ellen, who sat with downcast
eyes, clenched hands, and a heaving breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was but for a moment that Miss Orinda regarded
the girl; then she sprang to her feet. “Rosanne’s
child shall not go to an institution!” she cried. “Take
off your things, Ellen. You are going to live with
me, and pray Heaven you will make a capable, useful
woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen’s mute misery changed to an expression of
intense relief.  “Oh!”  she breathed tremblingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s good of you, Rindy,” declared Mr.
Crump, rising from his chair,  “though, after all, you
are the best fixed to give the girl a home. You live
alone, own your own house, have a garden, and in
this little place living can’t be as high as in the city.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Orinda tossed her head and looked at him scornfully
from under half-closed eyelids. She gave a little
bitter laugh. “Of course,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Susan,” said Mr. Crump, turning to his
sister,  “we may as well be getting on; it’s right smart
of a ride, you know. Good luck to you, Rindy.
Good-by, little girl. You’ve got a good home, and I
hope you’ll appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen answered never a word, but stood in silence
till all went out, Mrs. Barton drawing her handsome
furs about her as she entered her shining car. She
nodded and smiled her farewells as the car bowled off,
following the less elegant one of Mr. Crump. Miss
Orinda did not stop to watch them out of sight, but
shut the door hard, came back into the parlor, and
stood for a moment in front of the Latrobe stove
which heated the greater part of the small house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s that,” she said at last. “If any one
had told me this morning—— But, never mind.
Maybe I’m a fool, but I’d rather be some kinds of a
fool than a hide-bound, self-indulgent, cold-blooded
skinflint. I rather imagine there have been worse
fools in this room lately than I am. Come here, Ellen,
and let’s take stock of each other, since we’re to be
housemates.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen came readily. Miss Orinda held her off at
arm’s length and regarded her steadily. “You’re not
much like the Crumps,” she said presently. “You get
your hazel eyes from your mother, but your nose and
mouth from the Norths. It’s just as well, for the
Crumps aren’t much for looks usually.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle Josiah isn’t,” said Ellen in a decided voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Orinda smiled. “No, he’d never take a beauty
prize, neither would Susan. Lauretta wasn’t a particularly
pretty girl; she grew up to her looks somehow;
and you may, too, for you haven’t a bad beginning,
though no one could call you a prize beauty
either. Lauretta is about my age, a little older in
fact, but doesn’t look it. If I gaumed up my skin
with creams and clays, and was forever fiddling with
my hair, maybe I’d look younger, but life’s too short
for me to spend it messing with my old carcass, and
I haven’t an eye out for the men, so there you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While she was speaking Ellen was taking in her
own impressions. She didn’t guess her cousin’s age;
she was about forty-five, but looked older, for she
used no devices for increasing her charms. She wore
her dark hair straight back from her forehead, which
was too high for beauty; she had somewhat small, but
clear, frank gray eyes, a large nose, a straight, thin-lipped
mouth, long upper lip, decided chin, was of
medium height, slender, and straight. Her good
points were her finely-shaped head, well set, her figure,
her perfect teeth, and clear, unblemished skin. Ellen
had seen the gray eyes snap and the lips compress into
a hard, decided line, and concluded that some might
not find it easy to get along with Cousin Orinda
Crump.</p>

<p class='c009'>But then she had delivered her from that terror
which had threatened,—life in a charitable institution.
Tears gushed to Ellen’s eyes as she thought of this,
for she was an emotional, sensitive little body. She
gave a short gasping sob. “I want to kiss you,” she
faltered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Orinda patted her on the shoulder. “There,
there, child,” she soothed, as Ellen put her arms around
this deliverer from an unhappy fate. “I’m not much
of a hugger, not having had anything but a cat to hug
for a good many years, but if it would do you any
good to kiss me, go ahead and do it, only it isn’t to
become a daily habit, I warn you. We’ll get along
all right if you’re a good child. You’ll turn out to
be a real smart girl, I have no doubt, but I must
warn you right this minute that you can’t expect either
fine clothes or luxuries from me. We shall manage
to get along somehow, I dare say, but I shall expect
you to do your part.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I will, I will, Cousin Orinda,” promised Ellen
after giving the other a much less ardent kiss than she
desired to bestow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everybody in this town calls me Rindy Crump,
and maybe you’d better call me Cousin Rindy. What
name did you go by at home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mother always called me Ellen, but Daddy often
called me Nelly or Nell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ellen it shall be; that’s a nice sensible name. Now
then, Ellen, bring your bag up-stairs, and we’ll get
your room ready. We’ll send for your trunk to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Up one flight of steps they went to a plain little
room furnished with a bureau, a washstand, a small
white iron bedstead, and two chairs, but there was an
attempt at decoration, such as advertising calendars
and Christmas cards tacked on the walls, and on the
bureau a very hard pincushion. The mantel held two
ornate glass vases and a small bisque figure of a kneeling
Samuel. The small house contained but six rooms;
this one was next to Miss Rindy’s; above was an attic.
All was neat and orderly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now wash your face and hands,—the bathroom
is at the back,—put on an apron, and come down so I
can show you about setting the table,” said Miss
Rindy; “then you can help me get supper.” She
closed the door and went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen stood still for a moment and looked around.
This was her home! Her lip trembled, her eyes filled.
She dropped on her knees by the side of the bed and
gave way to a fit of weeping. It was all so different
from the home she had left, a dainty, artistic one.
But she must be thankful for this one; she was. Her
tears were half in regret for the things which were
lost to her forever, half in thankfulness for that which
was now provided.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, it was not like Ellen to remain long in the
depths. She was a courageous little soul, and the past
few weeks had been desperate enough to show her that
the ills we have sometimes can be so bad as to make us
grateful for a chance to try out those we know not
of; moreover, there was a call from below. She
sprang to her feet, bathed her face and hands, and
went down. If Miss Rindy noticed the traces of tears
she made no comment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t you an apron?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe I have in my trunk,” answered Ellen
doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here, put on this one of mine,” said Miss
Rindy, taking one down from a peg behind the door.
“Aprons are most useful members of society, they
cover a multitude of sins; they ought by rights to be
called charities instead of aprons.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The apron hung far below the hem of Ellen’s dress,
but that didn’t matter, as Miss Rindy remarked. “It’s
the fashion now to have floppy do-dabs switching about
below the edge of a skirt,” she said. “Not that I
hold to such silly styles. I thought Lauretta’s dress
too silly and fussy for words. Come along, Ellen,
I’ll show you where the dishes are. I don’t use tablecloths;
mats are much less trouble and more economical.
They are in that table drawer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen found them and laid them as directed; then
the rest of the table was set and she viewed it approvingly.
She liked the antique mahogany with the
old blue-and-white china upon it, but still there was
something missing. “Don’t you have flowers on the
table?” she inquired. “We always did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did? Well, I don’t; I can’t be bothered with
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen was silent for a moment before she asked,
“Would you mind if I bothered with them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me, I don’t know where you’d find any. I
don’t raise them; they’re like Lauretta, pretty but useless.
But, pshaw! I don’t see what’s got into me,
picking on Lauretta, though she always did rub me
the wrong way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe I could find something,” persisted Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re welcome to,” returned Miss Rindy from
the pantry where she had gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen opened the kitchen door and looked out. It
wasn’t very promising. A few green tomatoes still
hung on the vines, a scraggy apple tree bore several
apples at the top, and there was a row of cabbages
left in a patch at the back. None of these offered anything
like a bouquet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen went down the brick walk to investigate farther,
and presently discovered that a honeysuckle vine,
which had strayed from the neighboring yard and
hung over the fence, ventured to display a few late
blossoming sprays of which Ellen took immediate
possession. While doing this she observed that there
was an open lot bordering on the property. It was
easy to reach by climbing the low fence. An open
lot always presented all sorts of possibilities, and this
one, while somewhat disappointing, offered a sparse
supply of blooms which Ellen was quick to gather,—two
or three crimson clover-heads, a cluster of purple
asters, yarrow more plentiful, and two belated buttercups.
With the honeysuckle these would do very well,
and when at the last several frost-touched leaves of
woodbine added more color, Ellen returned well
pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>She ran into the kitchen. “Look, Cousin Rindy,
look!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy turned from her task of grating cheese.
“Well, I declare,” she exclaimed. “They’re nothing
but useless weeds, but they’re right pretty after all.
You can get a tumbler out of the pantry to put them
in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen set her bouquet proudly in the center of the
table on which Miss Rindy already had deposited a
plate of warmed-over rolls, a dish of stewed apples,
some plain gingerbread, and the grated cheese. There
was a glass of milk for Ellen, tea for herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a simple meal, but there was enough of it,
and Ellen rose from the table satisfied. She helped
her cousin with the dishes, and then they sat down
together in the parlor. The light from the big kerosene
lamp picked out the gleam of the two or three
ornately bound books on the marble-topped table, discovered
the gilt frames of “A Yard of Roses” and
the big chromo where woodeny waves threatened to
engulf a tin-like ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we’ll talk,” announced Miss Rindy, settling
herself in a heavy haircloth-covered rocking-chair.
“You will have to be provided with some work to do,
Ellen. You can’t sit all the evening just holding your
hands in that useless way. I don’t suppose you have
anything just now, but you can hold this worsted for
me and meantime tell me all about yourself. Of
course I know in a general way, but I want more information,
if you are going to live with me. You can
tell me what you choose, and I will read between the
lines.”</p>

    <div>ELLEN BEGINS TO BE USEFUL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ellen fixed her eyes on the ruddy isinglass in the
doors of the Latrobe. Certain discolorations
gave to her fancy strange pictures,—a glowing sunset
behind a line of trees, a burning lake beneath a cloudy
sky. She wondered if Cousin Rindy ever had noticed
them, but she did not ask, for her thoughts went galloping
off to the little studio apartment in a big city,
her home till three months ago. Now it was stripped
of all its furnishings, occupied by strangers, and Ellen
would know it no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on,” encouraged Miss Rindy after a short silence.
“You needn’t tell me where you were born;
I know that, and I know when your parents left you.
What I want to know is how you lived and all that.
You went to school, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I went to school, and I studied music and
French at home. Mother and Father generally spoke
it at meals. Even when I was quite small I could
chatter away rather glibly, for they wouldn’t let me
have things at table unless I asked for them in
French.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much good it will do you here. I don’t suppose
there are two persons in town who know a word of it,
unless maybe Jeremy Todd; the Todds live next door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you were in France and must speak it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A smattering, merely a smattering. I picked up
a little, naturally, but most of my dealings were with
our own boys, and I had enough to do without studying
French grammar. Did your mother do her own
work? How big was your flat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only three rooms besides the bath. The studio
and two rooms were all we needed. Mother got breakfast
on a little gas stove; we had just any sort of
lunch, and went out to dinner, sometimes to one place,
sometimes to another; that was while Father lived.
It was fun to decide which restaurant we could afford
to go to. If Dad was flush, we’d go to a swell place;
if he wasn’t, we’d go to a cheap cafeteria, but we
didn’t mind. Often we’d have a late supper. Some
of our artist friends would call up and say they were
going to bring some specially nice thing from the
delicatessen; then Mother would make coffee, and it
would be awfully jolly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph!” Miss Rindy grunted. “What did you
do when you were not at school?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I just knocked around, practised, of course.
Sometimes I sat for Dad when he had an illustration
to make, and often I washed his brushes. Often, too,
we’d all go out to some exhibition or a musicale. I
loved the musicales. Mother had a lovely voice, you
know; she sang in a church choir, and sometimes, after
Dad went, she sang at private houses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You still kept the studio while your father was in
France, and after he came back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, for he was always hoping to get back to
work, but he couldn’t, though he tried. You see it
was shell-shock, and he was gassed, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know, I know,” Miss Rindy breathed. “Poor
boys, poor boys, how many I have seen suffer. You
kept right on in the studio then while your mother
lived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, for she couldn’t bear to give it up; we had
all been so happy there, but at last the money gave out
and everything had to go. I hated to see Dad’s pictures
go for so little, and Mother’s piano, too, but it
had to be. I think it was the grief and shock and all
that which wore Mother out. The doctor said she had
no resistance, and when she took a heavy cold and had
pneumonia she hadn’t the strength to fight against it.”
Ellen tried to choke back her sobs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let’s talk about it,” said Miss Rindy herself,
feeling an emotion she did not want to show, but she
laid aside her knitting and patted Ellen’s hand furtively.
“Just tell me where you went after all that
happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First to one and then to another, but artists aren’t
usually very well off, though they do manage to have
such jolly times. They were all just as kind and
generous as could be, especially Mr. Barstow, one of
Dad’s best friends. He had a long talk with me before
he sailed for Europe, and said I was not to worry,
that he would hunt up some of my relatives, for it
was only right that they should know I was—homeless.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was quite right,” said Miss Rindy, again picking
up her knitting. “I was fond of your mother,
and I should be ashamed to have her daughter dependent
upon strangers. You don’t have to call yourself
homeless any more, you understand, for here you
are, and here you be as long as I have a roof over me
and a crust to share. I own this house and I have a
little income. It will be close cutting, but we sha’n’t
starve, I reckon. As for clothes, they don’t take as
much stuff as they used to, that’s one comfort. You’re
how old, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am just fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you’re not very big, and won’t need trains
even when you are grown up, so I reckon we won’t
have to lay out much on dry-goods. I must start you
to school first thing, and between school hours you
can be learning useful things. Can you sew?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little; I used to help Mother sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s something. Can you cook?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can make toast, and cocoa, and fudge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cake?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, we bought cake when we wanted it. We had
no real stove, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure. Funny way of living, but never mind,
you’re never too old to learn, and we’ll begin next
Saturday on gingerbread. What about clothes?
Have you enough to last a while?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ye-es, I think so; not many black things, and I
want to wear black.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you shall, for a while anyhow. What isn’t
black can be dyed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But dyeing is expensive, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t suppose for one minute that I’d send
anything to a dyer’s when you can get a package of
dye for ten cents? No, sir. When I want coloring
done I do it myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ‘Oh!’ I imagine you didn’t know that things
could be dyed at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do know, for lots of the women artists do
it when they want draperies or costumes and such
things. Mother never did because there was always
so much else to do, and because it wouldn’t have been
convenient.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll unpack your trunk to-morrow and then we
can tell what can be dyed. You can help me with the
stirring and rinsing. What about your mother’s
things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are in a trunk Mrs. Austin is keeping for
me. Mrs. Austin was one of our good friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better send for the trunk. No doubt there will
be many things in it that you can make use of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but—Mother’s things!” The tears rushed to
Ellen’s eyes. “I—I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, child, there. No doubt you feel that way
now, but in a little while you will love to wear them;
you’ll feel that she would like you to, and it will bring
her nearer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you—do you really think so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do. It may be hard at first, but you mustn’t
be over-sentimental; it doesn’t do for poor folks like
us, and you can’t afford to hoard away anything that
will be of practical use to you. We will attend to your
trunk first; meantime send for the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So as soon as Ellen’s trunk arrived Miss Rindy applied
herself to the task of going over its contents.
Most of the pretty, gay little dresses, with a faded
coat, were laid aside for dyeing, and the colored stockings
put with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These tan shoes can be made black easily,” decided
Miss Rindy; “so can that light felt hat. I can
reshape the hat over a bowl or a tin bucket. Let me
see those gloves. I can dye the cotton ones, but I’m
not so sure that I’d better undertake the kid; we’ll
see about that later. Can you knit, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, when it’s straight going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then this evening you can rip up that yellow
sweater. I’ll tie the worsted in hanks and dye it black,
then I’ll show you how to knit it over and you’ll have
a good sweater for school. Do the dresses all fit
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some of them I’ve outgrown; both those blue
serges are too small.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’ll rip them up, dye them together, and
make a good dress of them that will last you as long
as you need to wear black. Give me that piece of
blue ribbon; it will do to go around your hat
when it’s dyed. There now! I don’t see but you’re
all fixed up, or will be when we get everything
ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen was quite overcome by these suggestions of
her exceedingly resourceful cousin. “You’re a perfect
wonder, Cousin Rindy,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I never was placed in the bric-à-brac class,
pretty but useless, and I hope you’ll not be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll never be the first,” returned Ellen with a smile,
“and I don’t want to be the second.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s up to you,” returned Miss Rindy. “We’ll
start on these things to-morrow, Ellen. If it should
suddenly turn cold, you’ll need the coat and hat.
Those stockings you have on are disgracefully faded,
such a dirty green as they are. Haven’t you any other
black ones?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have a couple of pairs, but they are soiled and
need mending.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then get them out. Here, pile all those things on
one chair. Don’t leave them scattered around till your
room looks like a second-hand clothing shop. First
thing to do is to wash out those stockings, and, while
they are drying, you can run down to the drug store
and get the dye. This evening the stockings will be
dry and you can darn them. If you are to start to
school on Monday, your wardrobe must be in some
sort of shape.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Under her cousin’s directions Ellen soon had the
stockings washed and hung out; then she started forth
to get the dye. “But, you know, I haven’t an idea
where the store is,” she remarked as she paused at the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t miss it or anything else in this place,”
Miss Rindy answered. “Just follow your nose and
it will take you anywhere you want. Walk straight
down the street till you come to the church, the white
one, not the gray. It is just opposite the store, and
the store is opposite the church; it’s the post-office,
too. You can’t miss it. Now, run along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen started off to make her first venture into the
one long street of the drowsy old town. It was early
November, and a mat of red and gold leaves covered
the boardwalk, for the street was not paved. Houses,
set rather far apart, stood each side the street.
Most had gardens in front where a few late chrysanthemums
and scarlet salvia brightened the borders.
Some more thrifty households had vegetable plats in
which long, dry blades rustled from shorn cornstalks,
and purple cabbages squatted in rows farther along.
The air was full of the tang of fallen leaves, of apples,
wind-fallen, rotting on the ground. Once in a
while, from some kitchen where pickling was going
on, spicy odors were borne.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Ellen entered the general store she noticed that
it held a conglomeration of all sorts of goods. The
drugs were on a row of shelves at the farther end of
a long counter, neighboring the piles of gingham,
flannelettes, and such dry-goods. Next came canned
articles and groceries. These led the way to hardware,
which followed shoes. At the extreme end of the
store was the post-office. The middle of the store was
occupied by such vegetables and fruits as were in season.
In the glass cases were notions, candies, and stationery.
The loft up-stairs was given up to crockery
and house furnishings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen stood just inside the door for a moment and
looked around. She had never seen just such a place
in her life, and wondered how on earth the proprietors
managed to keep track of such a mixed stock. There
was no one in the store, but presently a voice from
behind the post-office box called out, “I’ll be there
in just a minute,” and before long a slim, dark-eyed
little woman appeared. “He’s gone to the city,”
she explained, “and I’m kind of short-handed, for
the boy has gone out with the orders. What was it
you wanted?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want some black dye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s it for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Orinda Crump.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Rindy Crump. What’s she going to dye?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Several things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silk, cotton, wool, or mixed goods?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, all kinds, I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I’d better give you a package for each, and
if she doesn’t need all, she can return what she doesn’t
use. Kin of hers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m her cousin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Making her a visit?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, ye-es. I’m going to live with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are? I did hear somebody say last night
that a power of Rindy’s kinfolks came down yesterday.
You don’t mean—— But never mind, I won’t ask
any more questions. Rindy can tell me all about it.
What did you say your name was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen hadn’t said, but she gave the desired information.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t favor the Crumps,” continued Mrs.
Perry; “none of them have red hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m like my father,” replied Ellen, tossing back
her shining, copper-colored locks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was a painter by trade, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An artist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Same thing. Did he do signs or houses?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither. He painted beautiful pictures.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much money in that, I reckon. He’d better
have stuck to the houses. Painters get good wages
these days. Well, Ellen, come again. I suppose you’ll
be running down for the mail every evening. It’ll be
nice for Rindy to have somebody to go on her errands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen picked up her package and stalked out, her
face aflame and rage in her heart. The red and yellow
leaves made no appeal to her. She saw no gay chrysanthemums
on her way back. She shut the door savagely
as she entered the house, threw the package on
the table, and tossed her hat on a chair. Then she
walked out to the kitchen where Miss Rindy was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said her cousin, “did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Cousin Rindy, I did,” Ellen responded.
“That horrid woman said you’d probably want all
the kinds there are. If you didn’t need them all, you
could return whichever package you didn’t want. She
is the most inquisitive person I ever saw, and I just
loathe her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whewee! What a pepper-jig you’re in. When
you’ve known Maria Perry as long as I have you’ll
find it isn’t worth while to get mad with her. She
can ask questions, I’ll admit, but she doesn’t mean
any harm by it. She’s the chief purveyor of news in
the town, and everybody looks to her for it, just as
if she were a headline on a newspaper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She asked me if my father painted houses or
signs. The idea of such a thing! When I told her
he painted pictures, she impertinently said she reckoned
there wasn’t much money in it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There wasn’t was there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes there was a great deal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it wasn’t what one might call a satisfying,
steady income. Never you mind, Ellen, don’t look so
much like a thundercloud. Go cool off, child. You’ll
have to get used to being talked over; it’s the prerogative
of the dwellers in a small place like this. A full
description of you will be broadcast all over the town
before night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you call my hair very red?” asked Ellen
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t suppose it will be reported that it is
black or gray, do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Daddy loved it, so did all the artists. They used
to say it was real Titian color.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That may be, but I don’t reckon there are many
of our neighbors who know anything about Titian, so
you’ll have to get used to being called red-headed.
Just keep your hair brushed and tidy-looking; that’s
all you’ll have to do. It doesn’t matter about looks.
I want you to be sensible and useful, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Useful Ellen; that’s what Daddy used to call me
sometimes when I brought him a piece of toast I had
made, or a cup of tea,” said Ellen dreamily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I hope you will carry on and always deserve
the name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are the next-door neighbors?” asked Ellen,
changing the subject. “I saw an odd-looking little
man who seemed a bit lame.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was Jeremy Todd. He is a musician, plays
the ’cello and gives lessons, besides being the organist
at our church.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, does he? How lovely! Mr. Barstow bought
the dear old violin that Daddy played. I was beginning
to play a little, too, but——” Ellen paused and
drew a long sigh. “Are the dyes all right, Cousin
Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, quite right. We’ll start in to-morrow and
get your things done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who lives on the other side of us, Cousin Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Dove-Hales. The Craig-Hales live the other
side of town.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw a darling little boy in there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Billy? Yes, he is a dear. We all call him Dovey.
Now put away your hat and coat and help me pare
these apples. We’re going to have a Brown Betty for
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Ellen turned to hang up her hat and coat she
stopped to ask, “Is that woman always in the store?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not always; she’s generally in the post-office,”
Miss Rindy smiled, “and she won’t like it if you
interrupt her when she’s getting dinner or about to
sit down to supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the post-office, isn’t it always expected that
there will be some one there to wait on you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t what you expect, it is what Maria thinks
about it. Her affairs are much more important than
the government’s. A batch of biscuits that might burn
is more to be considered than all the letters you or I
might write. But don’t let’s find fault with Maria;
she has about all she can do to run her house, the post-office,
and, often, the store. Mil Perry is a lazy lout
and piles all he can upon her thin shoulders. It must
be trying to have your biscuits burn up just because
some one wants a penny post-card. Get your apron,
Ellen, before you sit down.”</p>

    <div>VIOLINS AND DOVES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Within the next two or three days Ellen made
at least two or three friends. It was from
over the fence on one side that Jeremy Todd first
spoke to her, and over the fence on the other side that
she made the acquaintance of Billy Dove-Hale.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was gathering the last of the tomatoes which
grew near the side toward the Todds; Miss Rindy had
said they must be in before the frost nipped them.
Ellen was singing softly a little song of Schumann’s,
which had been a favorite of her mother’s, when
suddenly a head appeared over the fence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is that singing ‘Moonlight’?” said a man’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen looked up from where she was kneeling by a
big basket into which she was emptying her last gleanings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you know about Schumann?” asked the
man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother loved Schumann’s songs, so did my
father, and so do I.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are your mother and father, and who are
you, my child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My father was Gerald North, the artist. He, and
my mother, too, have left me alone on this earth. I
am Ellen North, and I am making my home with
Miss Rindy Crump. She is my cousin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes, I forgot; Bessie did tell me. It is a
sort of revelation to find any one from Miss Crump’s
singing Schumann. How do you like it here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—I—can’t tell exactly, not yet. It is a pretty
little town and I love the mountains.” She waved
her hand toward a distant line of purple. “Cousin
Rindy was very, very good to let me come when I
had nowhere to go, but—but it’s hard to get used to
things that are so different from where I have lived,
always in a studio, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somewhat different, one might judge,” returned
the man, smiling quizzically. “I can understand that,
having lived in a studio myself, away back in the days
of my youth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen sprang to her feet. “Oh, did you ever live
in a studio?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, years ago in Leipzig, where I was a student
of music, I lived with an artist friend. Aye! aye!
what good times we had! Germany then wasn’t what
it is to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you are a musician.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A would-be one. I am the organist at the little
church here, give lessons to the few pupils I can get,
play the ’cello and violin when I get a chance, and—there
you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My father played the violin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he and my mother often played together,
she at the piano and he with his violin. I used to love
to hear them as I lay in bed. It was so pleasant to
go to sleep with that lovely music in my ears.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can believe it, yes, I can well believe it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother had a beautiful voice. She sang in a
big church and sometimes in private houses,” Ellen
went on, wondering a little why she was so expansive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you, did you make some music, too?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I began to learn the piano and the violin, but—now——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have it with you, the father’s violin?” asked
Mr. Todd eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen shook her head. “No, it went with the piano
and everything else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too bad, too bad,” Mr. Todd shook his shaggy
gray head. “Perhaps—we’ll see. At any rate there
is Schumann to talk about. You have the songs,
maybe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those I still have; they are in my mother’s trunk
which is to be sent to me here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good! Some day——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But here a shrill voice interrupted: “Jeremy,
Jeremy, where are you? Hanging over the fence
dawdling away your time. I thought you were going
to dig those turnips.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear, I’ll do it right away,” answered the
man’s gentle voice. He turned to Ellen, shaking his
head. “Turnips and Schumann! Never mind, we
will have another talk soon. Good-by—Ellen, did you
say? I am glad you have come, child. We shall be
good friends.” He went off, and Ellen noticed that
he limped slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lugging the tomatoes, she went back to the house.
“There is quite a lot,” she said, setting the basket
down. “What do you think, Cousin Rindy, I have
been talking to Mr. Todd. Isn’t he a dear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph! Yes, there are more than I thought. I
can fry some of the ripest ones for supper, and the
rest will ripen along and last quite a while. So you
have been talking to Jeremy, poor old Jeremy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he so poor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s not what you would call rich except in a
beautiful optimism and a rare philosophy. Most persons
would call him a disappointed man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What disappointed him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he hadn’t much but talent to start with,
talent for music. He was always an up-in-the-clouds
sort of somebody, and when his father died he took
the small amount that was left him and went abroad.
He was getting along first rate, they said, when he
met with an accident, had a terrible fall while he and
a friend were taking a walking tour through Switzerland.
It was a long time before he was able to be
moved. His brother went over for him and brought
him back, and he was in a hospital for a long time. It
was there he met Bessie Stayman, who was one of
the nurses. She owned the house next door, and
finally brought him there; her mother was living then
and needed her care. Well, the upshot of it was that
she married Jeremy. Mind you <i>she</i> married <i>him</i>,
made a dead set at him. She was getting on, and it
was him or nobody. She made him believe—— Oh,
well, we won’t go into that. At all events it gave
him a home when he most needed it, and he didn’t
find out right away what a spitfire she is. If she only
sputtered it wouldn’t matter so much; I can stand
sputtering better than whining. But he hasn’t an easy
time of it, I’ll warrant. She orders him around like a
slave driver, wants things done on the minute, no
matter what. It doesn’t make any difference how he
may be occupied, if she wants a thing done, drop his
affairs he must to do her bidding, although it may be
by no means important that he should. He must tend
to fires, wash dishes, do any old thing. She won’t let
him practice on his ’cello because she doesn’t like to
hear it. So his only refuge is the church; he can always
make the excuse that his duty is there, and can
slip off when he can’t stand it any longer. But—well,
I call him a disappointed man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he seemed so dear and cheerful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s always that. He rises above conditions better
than most.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said we were sure to be friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You could have a worse one, but don’t let him
lead you off into dreaming dreams that can’t come
true. It is fortunate that I’ll be on hand to keep you
down to solid earth if he happens to carry you too
far up into the clouds.” Then, as if to punctuate her
remarks, Miss Rindy bade her young cousin sit down
to the task of darning stockings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having rolled up the last pair of stockings Ellen
obeyed a call from her cousin. “Ellen, I wish you’d
go out to the parsley bed and get me a few sprigs of
parsley; I always like it in cream gravy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Glad of an escape into the fresh air Ellen skipped
off. She wished the parsley bed were on the other
side of the garden, that she might, perhaps, see Mr.
Todd again, but it was in the part which bordered
upon the Hale property. From the Hale house came
the sound of a phonograph which was clashing out
jazz music. Ellen smiled as she thought of the contrast
between the two neighbors. She had not met
any of the Hale family, had merely seen that
Mrs. Hale was a pretty young woman who wore
startling costumes and seemed always to be on the
go.</p>

<p class='c009'>In competition with the phonograph she heard the
high, shrill voice of Lucilena, the maid of all work.
Unmindful of the rival phonograph, Lucilena with
great gusto announced that she was “climbing up
Zion’s hill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The conflicting noises were not to Ellen’s taste, and
she decided to make short work of gathering the
parsley. But, just as she was turning to go, a small
voice said, “Have you got a kitty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen looked around to see where the voice came
from, and discovered a pair of bright eyes peering
through an opening in the hedge. “Why, no,” she
replied, “I haven’t one, but my cousin, Miss Rindy
Crump, has one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I know that one; it’s a big old cat named
Wipers. I want a wittle kitty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry I haven’t one to give you,” returned
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you wike kitties?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had a wittle one would you give it to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I think so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wike dogs, too. I’m a dog sometimes, a wittle
white dog and my name’s Goo-Goo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a funny name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fink it’s a nice name. My name is Billy Dove-Hale;
Jeremy calls me Dovey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean Mr. Jeremy Todd?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Billy, having now withdrawn his head, was standing
on tiptoe, looking over the hedge at Ellen. He
ignored her question, instead asking one himself.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ellen North.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ewen Norf,” repeated Billy. “Is you ever an
angel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I is sometimes, and my name is Sara Phim. I
has wings and I can fly. Some day I is going up to
heaven and get a wittle sister.  I’d wather have one
zan a dog. Daddy’s going to get me a dog some day.
If you can find a wittle kitty will you bwing it to me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wike you. I wish you wived here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I do live here, with Miss Rindy Crump.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just here came a summons from the house. Lucilena
was calling: “You Billy, you Billy! Whar is
yuh? I ’clar yuh is de mos’ git-out-o’-de-wayes chile
uver I did see. Come in an’ git yo’ suppah fo’ I bus’es
yo’ haid open.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without a word of farewell Billy galloped off, or
rather took flight as he flapped his arms, wing fashion,
in his own estimation. “I’se comin’. I’se flyin’ fas’
like an angel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen could not determine whether it was the prospect
of supper or Lucilena’s terrible threat which
urged to promptness on Billy’s part, but she went smiling
into the kitchen with her bunch of parsley. “Isn’t
it funny,” she said, “that I’ve made two acquaintances
to-day, one each side the garden?” And she told of
her interview with Billy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s a funny little tyke,” declared Miss Rindy.
“What with the notions he gets from Lucilena and
the ones his own imagination supplies he is as full of
fancies as an egg is of meat. He is left to Lucilena
a great deal, for his mother is forever on the gad. A
flyaway sort of somebody she is, sweet as honey and
kind as can be, but no housekeeper. Everything goes
by sixes and sevens in that house, meals at any time,
feast one day, famine the next. I don’t see how Barry
stands it, or Lucilena either, but they all get along as
comfortably as a basket of puppies. It’s none of my
business, though my fingers do itch sometimes to get
at those rooms and put them in order. You’ll like
Marietta Hale, you can’t help it, and I don’t know but
I’d rather than not that she played the part of a fearful
example to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “Do you think I require that she
should?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy smiled in her queer one-sided way. “I
can’t tell yet; you’re a new broom. Now, suppose you
come here and see how I make this gravy, then look
at the biscuits in the oven. There’s nothing I like
better for supper than fried tomatoes and hot biscuits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not long after supper the bell rang. Miss Rindy
went to the door. “Why, Jeremy!” Ellen heard her
exclaim. “What brought you here? Come right in.
Glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd, with a violin under his arm, limped in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen looked up brightly. “Oh, Mr. Todd, isn’t
this nice!” she cried. “You’ve brought your violin.
Are you going to play for us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no, that isn’t exactly what I came for,” he
explained. “I thought maybe you would like me to
lend you this and permit me to help you with it once
in a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But——” Ellen looked apprehensively at her
cousin. “It’s very kind of you,” she went on hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know that I approve of Ellen wasting her
time with a fiddle,” objected Miss Rindy. “What
good would it do her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be perhaps a pleasure,” answered Mr.
Todd gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fiddle-dee-dee! Pleasure, indeed! Ellen and I
can’t afford useless pleasures. She will have her living
to make, and it’s dollars to doughnuts she will
never make it twanging a fiddle. Besides, I don’t
know that I could stand hearing the thing squeaking
out scales.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd’s clear blue eyes met Ellen’s hazel ones.
“Music might not be such a bad profession for her,”
he said reflectively. “She may have a very good voice
and—— Do you know anything at all about the
piano, child? Have you ever had any lessons?” He
turned to Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I studied with Mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good! Then what about the organ, Rindy? She
could practice in the church, I am sure, and who knows
but some day she could take my place, unless, indeed,
she could do better, which would not be a difficult
matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now that sounds sensible,” returned Miss Rindy
with satisfaction. “I don’t want to stand in the child’s
light when it comes to practical matters, but I don’t
want her to waste her time, fritter away her youth in
a perfectly useless way as so many young people do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t mean that she must be deprived of all
enjoyment. ‘All work and no play’—you know the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt she will get play enough, but I don’t
want her to be a mere toy, as the other part of the
old saw suggests. You and she talk the organ matter
over, and if it doesn’t interfere with her school or
her duties at home I have no objection. What do
you say, Ellen? Would you like to learn to play the
organ?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d just love it!” cried the girl excitedly. “I
love the violin, too, but if I can’t have both, which
of course I can’t, I’d adore to play the organ, to learn
all those lovely things from the old masters, Beethoven,
Mozart, Bach, and all the rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then consider yourself my pupil.” Mr. Todd’s
face was wreathed with smiles. “We’ll have the first
lesson—— Let me see—when can you spare her,
Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why——” Miss Rindy considered the question.
“I suppose she could always have a half hour late in
the afternoon when she has done her lessons for the
next day, or on Saturdays.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But——” Ellen suddenly looked distressed.
“I—I’ve no money, Mr. Todd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His usually gentle face took on a frowning expression.
“The daughter of one of our soldiers, who
gave his life for a noble cause, needs no money in
exchange for the little I can give her. Permit me,
my dear child, to offer this much in honor of your
brave father. You understand, Rindy, that I shall
consider it a high privilege, aside from the pleasure
it will give me, to have such a pupil, for it is a red-letter
day when I meet a kindred soul such as she is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A whimsical smile flickered around Miss Rindy’s
mouth. “Very well, Jeremy, all I ask is that you
don’t haul her too high up into the clouds with your
sentimentality. The practical part is all right, and I
appreciate it and your goodness. I hope Ellen will
do her part and come up to your expectations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There isn’t the least doubt in my mind but she
will,” responded Mr. Todd as he rose to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may as well take your fiddle,” charged Miss
Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd picked up the violin. “We needn’t discuss
this with any one,—with—ah—Bessie, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A mischievous gleam came into Miss Rindy’s gray
eyes. “Certainly not. I wouldn’t think of discussing
it with—Bessie, for instance.”</p>

    <div>CALLERS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The remainder of the week brought a string of
visitors, for Mrs. Perry had not been slow in
spreading the news of the new inmate of Miss Rindy
Crump’s home, and all were curious to know what
this young person might be like.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning after Mr. Todd’s call Marietta Hale
came running in with a plate of hot rolls. “I just
thought I’d bring these in myself,” she said. “Lucilena
this minute took them out of the oven, and they’re
piping hot. Barry wasn’t quite ready for breakfast.
This your niece, Miss Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My cousin,” corrected Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I remember Mrs. Perry did say cousin.
I’m glad she’s come. Billy took such a fancy to her.
He told me there was a ‘wovewy young wady’ next
door; he has trouble with his <i>l</i>’s you know.” She
smiled upon Ellen, who, in the grace of her girlish
slimness, appealed to the plump Marietta just as she
had appealed to Jeremy Todd. “Do run in often to
see me,” Mrs. Hale added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean to see Billy; she wouldn’t be liable to
find you at home,” remarked Miss Rindy with a
twinkle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Miss Rindy, you know I’m not always out,”
protested Marietta laughing. She was always good-natured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t know the time when I’ve not met
you either going or coming,” retorted Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that means you are out as often as I am,”
declared Marietta triumphantly, and after this parting
shot she announced that she must fly or Barry
would be mad because she kept breakfast waiting;
“though, goodness knows, he does it often enough
himself,” she said as she went out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s rather a good sort, flibbertigibbet though
she is,” admitted Miss Rindy. “She’s as generous
as they make ’em, good-tempered, too. You never
hear her pick people to pieces the way some do. You
needn’t smile, Ellen; I know I do a good deal of
criticising myself, but I try not to make it ill-natured.
Besides I am analyzing the townsfolk for your benefit,
so you may know what to expect. I suppose you’d
find out for yourself in time, but forewarned is forearmed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The day was still young when Ellen discovered that
she had not been forewarned in the case of Miss
Sophia Garrett, who came in before the morning work
was quite done. She was a lady of uncertain years
but of no uncertain opinions. She prided herself upon
being blunt and outspoken, avowing that she would
speak the truth at any cost.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Rindy,” she began as she entered, “where’s
the girl? I hear you have taken on a new responsibility.
I hope you haven’t done anything rash, committed
yourself so to speak. It is a serious undertaking
to assume the care of a giddy young girl. Nobody
can tell how she will turn out, and if she grows
up to be a slattern or a light character, you will be
censured for not bringing her up as you should.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ellen may be young, but I don’t believe any one
could charge her with being giddy,” Miss Rindy retorted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you never can tell. A new broom sweeps
clean. Are you going to train her as a servant or a
lady? Is she bound out to you till she is eighteen?
Somebody suggested that you had found her in an
orphan asylum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then somebody spoke falsely.” Miss Rindy’s firm
lips straightened to a hard line. “She is my cousin,
and, being such, should not fail to be a lady. Come
in, Ellen,” she invited as Ellen appeared at the door.
“This is my young cousin, Ellen North, and Ellen,
this is Miss Sophia Garrett, an old schoolmate of
mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Garrett offered her hand and proceeded to
look Ellen over with a critical eye. “Humph! she
has red hair; that always means a high temper. It’s
well she hasn’t the light eyebrows and eyelashes
that generally go with red hair. She doesn’t look to
be so very strong, but then maybe she’s one of the
wiry kind. I like a bigger nose and a smaller mouth,
myself.” Miss Garrett admired no features that
did not resemble her own, no possessions which were
unlike those she had. She was a short, chunky sort
of person with thick arms and legs, big head, large
nose, small mouth, and long chin. She had very large,
prominent light blue eyes, and mouse-colored hair.
She was distinctly the opposite of the type which Ellen
had always been taught to admire, although she evidently
was very much satisfied with herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>After her survey of Ellen the questions began again.
“Father and mother dead, did you say?” She turned
to Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t say, but it is a fact,” returned Miss Rindy
tartly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did they die of? I hope it wasn’t consumption;
it would be too bad if she brought the
germs into this house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was not consumption. Cousin Gerald was
gassed and suffered from shell-shock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the war, was he? Oh, yes. And the mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Died of pneumonia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me! Was that before or after the husband?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“After.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I must say I think it’s pretty hard on you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I consider it is a privilege. Even if Ellen were
not a relative I would be glad to be permitted to do
my bit for the child of one of our own men. I saw
enough when I was in France to appreciate all they
went through. I certainly should be willing to share
what I have with one of my own blood, setting aside
the question of patriotism.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How old is the girl?” asked Miss Garrett, changing
the subject back to Ellen herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is fifteen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Small for her age, isn’t she? But there’s time
for her to grow. Going to send her to school, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most certainly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>During these interrogations Ellen was most unhappy.
She looked pleadingly at her cousin, who understood
and made the suggestion that she should go
into the kitchen to see if the soup were boiling over;
and the girl, grateful for a chance to escape, obeyed
with alacrity, hearing, however, as she went out, that
Miss Garrett had started a new topic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speaking of schools,” Miss Sophia began, “did
you hear about the new teacher? She went riding
alone with a young man last Sunday afternoon when
she should have been in Sunday school teaching a
class and behaving herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you call that misbehaving?” was what Ellen
heard her cousin ask.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she heard no more, for the soup was not boiling
over, so she went down to the back lot in order
to get away as far as possible. Later she saw Miss
Garrett going down the street, so, returning, she found
her cousin sitting with some sewing, the cat in her lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled quizzically as Ellen entered. “Well,
how did you like Miss Garrett?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t like her at all,” answered Ellen hotly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you didn’t. I needn’t have asked the
question. She is a gossipy old frump. She is so
strait-laced it’s a wonder she doesn’t break in two.
Virtuous? Oh, yes, she has all the Christian virtues
except charity. I call her an article of bigotry and
virtue, for she is narrow-minded to the last degree,
and has no use for any one who doesn’t live up to
her standards. She has not cottoned to me much
since I came back from overseas, and I was rather
surprised to see her this morning. She came only out
of curiosity, of course, for she doesn’t love me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see what she could have against you.”
Ellen was ready to take up the cudgels.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I gave a little talk before the Guild one day, and
she has scarcely spoken to me since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What could you have said to offend her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know; she was offended on general
principles. For one thing I said that self-esteem
doesn’t like suggestion, gives suggestion but won’t
take it; that the Kaiser was such an example of self-aggrandizement,
vainglory, and hypocrisy that he
might really do some good by showing the world how
despicable those qualities are. Then she thought I
was utterly lost when I told my audience that the
men in the trenches considered cowardice, selfishness,
niggardliness, and boastfulness were the cardinal sins,
worse, well, than some other things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know; I’ve heard my father say that, too,”
responded Ellen. “I think it was splendid for you
to go over and help, Cousin Rindy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why shouldn’t I have gone? There was nothing
to prevent. Nobody suffered by my going. It was a
great experience, and I did help a little, whatever
Sophia may think of it. The trouble with her is that
she looms up so large in her foreground that others
can be seen only around the edges of her personality;
that never gets any one very far. Get down, Wipers;
you’re in the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you call him Wipers?” asked Ellen, picking
up the big gray cat and cuddling him in her arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the way the boys pronounced Ypres, and
it is in memory of war days. I wanted an original
name and I have it, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do, indeed. I like it better now that I know.
Are there many others in town as gossipy and critical
as Miss Garrett and Mrs. Perry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, as far as I know I should say that they head
the list.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is one thing to be thankful for, and that is
our neighbors on both sides are as nice as can be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t met Bessie Todd yet,” returned Miss
Rindy grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was true, and Ellen appreciated the sly reference
not long after when a great ki-yiing in the garden
took her out to see what was going on. She discovered
that Wipers had wreathed himself around the
neck of Mrs. Todd’s little dog, Bunty. Wipers had
borne much from Bunty, who, once too often, had intruded
himself into Miss Crump’s premises, for the
sole purpose of worrying his furry neighbor, and now
was receiving entirely unexpected but well-deserved
punishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen rushed to the gap in the fence where the
affray was going on and was confronted by a large,
irate woman who screamed out: “Drive off your cat.
The horrid, savage beast, to attack a harmless little
dog like Bunty!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s been teasing the cat,” Ellen defended. “He’s
been doing it for days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he’s never done the creature any harm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because Wipers was too smart for him; he would
have done it fast enough if he’d been given a chance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish he had. Let me catch that cat on my
premises and I’ll let it know what boiling water feels
like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you wouldn’t be so cruel,” cried Ellen.
“Would you like us to throw hot water on your dog
when he comes in here? He does it every day, and
has no business to.” Ellen’s dander was up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you, miss, to give impudence, I’d like to
know?” retorted the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m Ellen North, and I live at Miss Crump’s.
Wipers has just as good a right to defend himself as
your dog has.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let him keep his own side the fence;” Mrs.
Todd was cooling off a little.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly what he was doing when your dog chased
him. The dog was the intruder, not Wipers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Wipers had relinquished his hold upon
the whimpering Bunty. Ellen picked him up and bore
him back to the house, hearing Mrs. Todd’s angry
tones growing fainter and fainter as she retreated to
her own door.</p>

<p class='c009'>With flushed cheeks and excited voice Ellen, almost
in tears, gave her account of the fracas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy listened attentively. “I like dogs, but
I like cats, too, and better than any other dog or cat
I like Wipers, so I’m glad he has put the fear of cats
into Bunty’s cowardly little soul. I’ll warrant he’ll
not venture into this yard again, not when Wipers is
there. One lesson will be enough for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Mrs. Todd said she would throw hot water on
Wipers if he went in there again, and cats will prowl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She won’t. She’s like her dog, her bark is worse
than her bite. That’s Bessie Todd all over. You’d
think she was going to tear you to pieces, and the
next thing she’ll be handing you a plate of fried
chicken over the fence. I haven’t been her neighbor
all this while for nothing. It doesn’t do any good to
bandy words with her. It’s best to wait till she gets
over her pepper-jig before you say anything. The
Irish will crop out when she gets mad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is she Irish?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her mother was. We won’t carry on a feud,
Ellen. You’ll see that her sputtering doesn’t amount
to anything. Like as not the next time you see her
she’ll be stroking Wipers and calling him a nice kitty.
I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Sunday Ellen discovered that her cousin
was right, for the lady smiled and bowed most
graciously as they all came out of church. Ellen was
arrayed in her newly dyed garments and felt very
respectable. The black was very becoming to her fair
skin and rippling tawny hair. Miss Rindy was evidently
proud of her, introducing her right and left as,
“My little girl, Ellen North.” When they walked up
the street with the Todds, Ellen fell behind with
Jeremy while Mrs. Todd chatted away vivaciously
with Miss Rindy, the two appearing to be on the best
of terms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You noticed that I played ‘Warum’ for the offertory
this morning,” said Mr. Todd to his companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I did notice, and I could scarcely keep back
the tears. ‘Why? Why?’ it kept saying to me, and
I wondered why trouble and grief must come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know, I know, but you must not be unhappy,
little Ellen. A good man has said: ‘It is not by change
of circumstances, but by fitting our spirits to the circumstances
in which God has placed us, that we can
be reconciled to life and duty.’ And another says that
trouble ‘brings for us, if we will accept it, the boon
of fortitude, patience, self-control, wisdom, sympathy,
faith.’ Those are big things to gain, Ellen,—big
things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen smiled rather wistfully. “I’ll try to remember,”
she replied.</p>

    <div>SCHOOL DAYS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Four walls enclosing countless eyes which were
fixed upon her critically, was the impression which
Ellen received on Monday morning when she entered
the schoolroom. Miss Hawley,  her prospective
teacher, was one of those who had called during the
week. Ellen wondered if she would seem less awesome
upon further acquaintance, for she was dignified,
tall, handsome, and unapproachable. Next to Ellen on
one side sat Carolyn Rowe, a nice wholesome-looking
girl with wide-open blue eyes and a winning smile.
On the other side sat Florence Ives, who was constantly
fluffing up her bobbed hair, which stood out like
a bush around her rather large head. Florence had a
simpering expression, an affected lisp, and a way of
drooping and half closing her eyes to make them appear
dreamy. She was much made up, and was continually
but furtively powdering her nose or looking
at herself in the small mirror she kept within her desk.</p>

<p class='c009'>In glancing around the room Ellen decided that she
would like Carolyn better than any of the other girls,
and she hoped the girl would take a fancy to her. So
at recess she was glad to meet Carolyn’s advances
with more graciousness than she exhibited toward the
others, though most of these appeared disposed to be
friendly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen soon discovered that Carolyn was not possessed
of much imagination, but was a conscientious,
plodding student with great respect for the attainments
of others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll never be brilliant,” she confided to Ellen,
“though I do hope I won’t turn out to be an utter
idiot. What are your favorite studies, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Music and French,” Ellen answered promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” Carolyn looked surprised. “I must say
that I’ve never aspired to be a musician. I hate to
practise. I began lessons on the piano, but I was so
unhappy over them that Father said it was foolish for
me to keep on. I might like French if there were a
chance to study it, but who in the world would teach
me? It isn’t taught in this school. I’m afraid you’ll
have to give it up, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t believe I need to. I have quite a number
of French books, and I can keep on reading those,
even if I have no one to talk to. It isn’t a bad plan
to read aloud so as not to lose the accent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you really read it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes, not so very fluently, but I manage pretty
well with a dictionary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How smart you are. You could read aloud to me,
couldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you wouldn’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That wouldn’t matter. I’d like the sound.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “You are very good to want to
listen to my halting accents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring one of your books to school to-morrow and
read to me at recess, or, better still, come over to
my house. Oh, no; I must call on you first, because
you are the stranger here; then when you return
the call you can bring the book and read to me.
We can go into Dad’s office; he’s a doctor, you know,
and when he is out making his visits we can have
the office all to ourselves. I almost always study in
there for it is nice and quiet and nobody disturbs me.
What are you going to do about your music? Miss
Rindy hasn’t a piano, has she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going to take lessons from Mr. Todd on the
organ. I can practise at the church, he says.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really? Can you play at all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not on the organ, but on the piano. I used to
play duets with my mother. We loved the old masters,
Beethoven and Mozart and those. We studied some
of their symphonies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That highbrow stuff? Oh, dear, I’d never fall for
that. Jazz is about all I can appreciate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you like best to study?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like to study at all, not really, but if I’ve
got to, I want to do my best and get somewhere. I
wouldn’t disappoint Father and Mother for the world,
particularly Father. He takes such pride in my reports
when they’re good.” She did not explain that
they were seldom anything else.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Florence Ives came up with her most insinuating
lisp. “I wath jutht wondering what you two
were talking about,” she began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were talking about studying,” Carolyn told
her. “Just think, Flo, Ellen can read French. This
is Ellen North, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know.” Florence gave Ellen a nod of recognition.
“How pairfectly wonderful that she readth
French. I wish I could. Thome day maybe I’ll learn.
Mamma wanth me to go to Parith to finish. They
thay one can learn a language better where they
thpeak it all the time; ith much the eathietht way. I
never mean to thudy any harder than I can help.
Jutht enough to let me thlip through. Can’t you take
a walk with me thith afternoon, Caro? We might
meet thome boys who’d join uth. Thereth a real handthome
new boy at Fuller’th.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let him stay there,” retorted Caro. “I don’t
want to see him. I’ve got my algebra to tackle anyway,
so count me out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You old greathy grind! What do you want to do
that for? What ith an algebra problem more or leth?
Have all the fun you can get and let the old algebra
go, I thay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir, duty first and pleasure after. If you must
go boy hunting, find some better companion. There
are plenty of others. Me for the unknown quantities.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ithn’t she an old thoberthideth?” exclaimed Florence.
“You come, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I have my practising to do and then my
lessons.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a pair of old thtick-in-the-mudth,” declared
Florence walking away in disgust, leaving Ellen more
drawn to Caro than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s such a silly child,” commented Caro.
“Now I like fun just as well as anybody, but I never
did see any in running after boys. Lots of the girls
do it, I know, but I think they make themselves perfectly
ridiculous giggling and making eyes at every
boy they meet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you like boys?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, well enough, but not in that silly way, certainly
not enough to run after them. Do you like
them, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, yes, I think so. I’ve never known very
many. Living in a studio as we did, there wasn’t
much chance of meeting them. Father and Mother
entertained only the grown-up artists and musicians,
and they were always such fun that I didn’t miss
younger company. If I had gone to an art school I
suppose I might have met dozens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think of you living in a studio. How wonderful!”
Caro looked at her companion as if she were
a being from another world, which in a certain sense
she was.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this hour Carolyn was Ellen’s devoted admirer.
Ellen’s past experiences fascinated her. She
was a creature of romance, one quite outside the usual
humdrum person of every day, who had lived in a
mysterious world of her own, who had gone through
tragic experiences, and was, as Caro declared, “just
like a heroine in a book.” Every now and then some
new chapter was opened over which Caro gloated, and
this sympathy and interest meant much to Ellen, although
Caro was not a congenial companion in all
directions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Very often the two studied together in Dr. Rowe’s
office, Ellen’s brighter mind getting at results more
quickly than Caro’s duller one; yet Caro’s knowledge
stuck by her, and many a time she was able to supply
a reference or rule which Ellen had forgotten. Once
in a while she would insist that Ellen read French to
her, which Ellen, amused, would do, wondering how
Caro could enjoy it when not one word did she understand.
She insisted, however, that she liked the sound.
The fact of the matter was that she so adored Ellen
it was enough for her to hear her voice. Moreover,
it gave her an excuse to keep her adored one longer
with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the days went on. To the dingy old schoolhouse,
set back in a bare yard, Ellen took her way each morning.
It was situated midway between the two ends of
the quiet little town. About it clustered such buildings
as Perry’s store, another small one kept by Miss Malvina
Sparks, a bakery and ice-cream saloon, the two
churches, and the one hotel, dignified by the name of
the Mansion House. Along the front of this almost
any hour of the day was seen a row of men in tipped back
chairs, drummers waiting for their train, idlers
passing away the time in political gossip, or tourists
obliged to stop over while their cars were being repaired.
Beyond the hotel were the blacksmith’s shop
and a garage, and beyond these the houses began again,
stretching as far north as the big factory of Sylvester
Ives, and, after a vacant space, houses again, continuing
as far north at this end of the town as they
did south on the other, and gradually standing farther
and farther apart till their surroundings became farm
lands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Carolyn’s devotion to Ellen soon became a live topic
with the schoolgirls. “Caro hath an awful cruth on
that red-headed Ellen North,” Florence was wont to
say jealously. “There ithn’t a day that she doethn’t
bring her thomething. To-day it wath fudge, and
yethterday it wath caketh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps she thinks she doesn’t get enough to
eat at Miss Rindy’s,” suggested Marcia Sloane maliciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, March, I don’t think it is nice for you to say
that,” objected Sally Cooper. “Every one knows that
Miss Rindy isn’t rich, but she belongs to one of the
best families.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no one would guess it from the way she
dresses that airish Ellen,” retorted Marcia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think she is a bit airish,” protested Sally;
“she is just artistic. I know plenty of persons who
admire her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to know who they are,” said Florence
scornfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of them you would be very pleased to have
admire you,” Sally answered back, now having taken
up the cudgels in good earnest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you pleathe to tell me who you mean,” returned
Florence in a haughty tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you needn’t look so scornful. It was Clyde
Fawcett. I heard him say to your own brother, Frank,
that he thought Ellen North was going to be a stunner,
and Frank said: ‘I think she is now. She can have
me.’ So there, miss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Florence’s eyes no longer looked dreamy, but flashed
anger. “I think you’re perfectly horrid,” she exclaimed.
“Come on, March.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sally, nothing abashed, walked across the school
yard to where Ellen and Caro were sitting. She had
made Ellen’s cause hers, and meant to so assert it.
Hereafter Florence’s clique would no more name her
as one of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite true that Caro was assiduous in her
attentions, for scarce a day passed that she did not
offer up something upon the altar of her friendship,—a
particularly big red apple, a package of fudge, a
little basket of persimmons, one of chinquapins, or of
nuts. Ellen accepted all these gratefully, and though
she rather wearied of Caro’s caresses and words of endearment,
often they comforted the lonely girl, who
no longer received such marks of affection, Miss
Rindy not being given to demonstration. However,
she gave a sturdy sort of love to her young cousin,
while her keen sense of humor saved situations which
might have become difficult, or even tragic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re none of us paragons of perfection; you
are not any more than the rest of the world,” she said
one day when Ellen was repeating some of Caro’s remarks.
“Compliments and appreciation are all very
well in their way; they are the ice-cream and cake of
life, but if you are going to depend upon them for a
steady diet, you will have spiritual indigestion as sure
as you’re born. We need to be bucked up by good
honest criticism; that’s the roast beef.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what is the bread and butter?” Ellen asked
laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Work, like bread, is the staff of life; and butter,
well, butter is the consciousness of having done our
work as well as we could; the more you slight it the
thinner it spreads.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose that’s true,” returned Ellen thoughtfully.
“But don’t you like compliments, Cousin
Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose, like other fools, I do, but I shouldn’t;
they’re weakening to the character, they breed self-conceit,
develop an inflated ego. Of all insufferable people,
conceited ones are the worst. I’ve known some,
a good many, too, who always set the highest value
upon their own performances, but never valued what
others did for them; placed their own affairs in the
limelight, and never in the least appreciated what
others did, in fact underrated the good deeds of others
and vaunted their own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One does like to be encouraged. I’m afraid I do
need encouragement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but encouragement is a different thing from
vain compliments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t your mother compliment you and commend
you for things when you did them well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy was silent a moment and a grim look
passed over her face. “No, I can’t say that she did.
My brother was always the favorite. She expected
everything of me, but I can’t say that I was fed up on
compliments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know you had a brother. Is he living?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, married and living in Seattle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh.” Ellen wondered why she had never heard
of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother was an invalid for many years,” Miss
Rindy went on. “She doted on Albert from the time
he was a baby, for he was a very pretty child, and I
wasn’t. He was gentle and good-natured, which I
was not. Poor Mother adored beauty. She was romantic
and sentimental. Her eldest child, my sister
Cora, was a beauty and Mother was very proud of
her, but she died when she was sixteen, and then plain
little Rindy was the one that was left. I don’t think
my mother ever got over the fact that the beauty was
taken and the plain one left, so she poured out all her
affection and pride upon Albert, spoiled him utterly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She paused, but Ellen saw a look upon her face
which made her go over to her cousin and put her
arms around her. “You dear, you dear,” she murmured.
“You are perfectly beautiful to me, and I
know you were to all those boys overseas that you did
so much for.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy turned her head away. “Don’t,” she
said; but Ellen saw that there were tears in her eyes
when again she took up her work.</p>

<p class='c009'>This conversation not only made Ellen more appreciative
of what her cousin was doing for her, but
it made her eager to have more light thrown upon her
history, and who could tell her better than Jeremy
Todd, who had known Rindy Crump all his life. So to
Jeremy did Ellen go for information.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was one afternoon when the light was streaming
in through the stained-glass windows of the little
church. The organ lesson was over, and Jeremy had
finished playing one of Ellen’s favorite sonatas. He
never failed to do this after the lesson; then they would
talk for a while and walk home together.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen waited till the last chords died away before
she said: “You knew Cousin Rindy’s brother, didn’t
you, Mr. Todd? What sort of person was he?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Know Al Crump? Oh, yes, of course I knew
him; a mighty agreeable person he was, everybody
liked him, but he had no sort of stability about him,
visionary, into any sort of scheme that came up, good
looking and good tempered, but selfish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never knew till the other day that Cousin Rindy
had a brother; she never mentions him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is not surprising, considering that she has
not heard from him for years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she knows where he is; she told me he lived
in Seattle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So he does, but she doesn’t know it from him.
Some of his old friends keep her informed. He is
doing pretty well, I believe, has found his niche at
last, and, having been thrown on his own resources,
has worked out a better career than he could have
done here. Probably it took a long time for his judgment
to mature; it is that way sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did they quarrel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He and Rindy? Well, yes, I suppose you may
say they did. You see he had absorbed everything his
mother had, she never denied him anything he asked,
so when she died all there was left was the house,
which belongs to Rindy, left her by an aunt who had
good sense enough to look out for her. I believe there
was a little money left with it, besides. Albert was
simply furious because Rindy refused to mortgage
the house and let him invest her money in some wildcat
scheme, but she set her foot down, wouldn’t
budge an inch, and told him that a big husky man
had absolutely no right to ask a woman to strip herself
of her living that he might sink it in some
worthless investment. He already had defrauded
her of her share of her father’s property, which her
mother had let him have to invest from time to time,
and now that it was gone she meant to hold on to what
was hers in her own right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good! I am glad she had the courage to say
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was exactly the best thing to say, although it
sent Albert off in a rage. He never had been talked
to like that, consequently he had been slow in developing.
Petted and indulged, admired and flattered, he
couldn’t see how any one should think he was anything
but perfect. There must have been good stuff
in him, for now he is making good, has waked up to
a realization of the fact that if one expects to get
anywhere he must use his own feet and not expect always
to be carried.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does Cousin Rindy know he is making good?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, and I think it is a satisfaction to her,
although it must be bitter to think that after all her
sacrifices for him and her mother he is so indifferent
to her. Nobody has ever done anything for Rindy,
but all her life she has done for others. She never
had any youth, for she had to bear all the burdens,
had to see her brother strut off dressed up in handsome
clothes while she sat at home and drudged for
him and her invalid mother, scarcely knowing what it
was to have a decent new dress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How horrid! How mean!” cried Ellen, starting
up. “And now she is drudging for me. I’ll make it
up to her some day, see if I don’t; and if I see any
chance now to give her a good time, I’ll do it. You’ll
tell me, won’t you, Mr. Todd, if you hear of any way
she can have some fun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you,” he replied, smiling at her excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so glad you told me all this, for now I shall
try to be as useful to her as I possibly can. Just think
what she is doing for me, keeping me out of an orphanage,
very likely. I’d be a perfect pig not to appreciate
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd nodded, with the thought in his mind
that Miss Rindy might truly be said to have cast her
bread upon the waters, but that he was convinced of
its return to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>They passed out of the dim and shadowy old
church into the bright sunlight, and walked slowly
toward home. On their way they encountered their
small neighbor, Billy Hale, running madly after two
small dogs who were trotting side by side down the
middle of the street. Billy had a tin cup of water in
his hand, and just as Ellen and her companion came
up the youngster had succeeded in dashing the last
of the water over the two dogs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What in the world are you doing, Billy?” asked
Ellen, stopping short.</p>

<p class='c009'>He came prancing up, glee written on his rosy face.
“Now they’re married,” he exclaimed joyfully;
“they’ve had a wetting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen turned with a puzzled look to Mr. Todd, who
threw back his head and shouted with laughter.
“Don’t you understand?” he said. “Dovey means
a wedding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” Billy nodded cheerfully; “they’ve had a
wetting, so they’re married.” He slipped his small
hand into Ellen’s and looked smilingly up at her.
“My mamma is going to a wetting next week; she
said so; it is going to be in the church. I wish she’d
take me. Do you think they’ll sing about Sara
Phim?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ask Mr. Todd; he can tell all about the music, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will they sing about Sara Phim?” asked Billy,
turning his attention to the organist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not this time,” was the response.</p>

<p class='c009'>By now they had reached Mr. Todd’s gate. Hearing
Lucilena’s terrifying threat that if he didn’t come
home a-bilin’ she’d skin him alive, Billy dashed on
while Ellen lingered a moment by the gate. “Such a
fanciful little monkey as he is,” she said. “I must
tell Cousin Rindy about the wetting; she loves Billy’s
funny little sayings. You won’t forget, will you, Mr.
Todd, to think up some way that I can earn some
money or do something for Cousin Rindy? I am in
dead earnest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen nodded, waved her hand, and passed on. Mr.
Todd opened the gate and went in. Half-way up the
walk he stopped short. “I believe I have it,” he exclaimed.
“To be sure. Why not? I’ll find out to-morrow.”
Then he went on.</p>

    <div>A BIRTHDAY PARTY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was almost summer, however, before Jeremy
Todd was able to carry out the plan which had
occurred to him on the day when the dogs had had
their “wetting.” In the meantime the days had gone
busily for Ellen. What with keeping up with her
class at school, performing the duties her cousin allotted
her at home, and giving such attention as was
possible to her music, there was no time for moping.
Christmas passed quietly. Some little gifts came from
the old friends in the city, Caro gave her a large box
of candy which brought the charge from Miss Rindy
that she was not to make herself sick eating it, and
from some unknown quarter came a box of flowers.
Dear old Jeremy smuggled in a set of Browning, looking
furtively around as he produced it, as if he suspected
Bessie would be on his track. Miss Rindy
sniffed when Ellen displayed the gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see where he got the money to buy it,” she
said. “Perfect nonsense, anyway. Don’t try to make
me read the stuff.” Ellen, however, was delighted,
and ransacked her mother’s trunks, at last pouncing
on a collection of bound music which was almost new,
and which she decided would make a suitable gift for
her good friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her happiest hours were those spent in the church
at the organ, or in listening to Jeremy as he poured
forth his soul in music. Ellen made great progress, to
the intense satisfaction of her teacher. “Not a doubt
but you’ll take my place one of these days,” he told
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t want to take your place,” declared
Ellen vehemently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not when I’m no longer able to do my duty by
the old organ? I’m counting on you as my successor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen had no answer to make to this, for it was a
subject she did not care to dwell upon.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day in May, when trees were in blossom and
birds were singing, Jeremy wound up his playing with
Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song,” saying, as he turned
on his bench, “Hackneyed as it is, I had to play that
to-day. Songs without words are all around us, and
we must join in. Let’s see how well you can play
the ‘Wedding March’ for the birds who are mating.”
He produced the music and gave his place to Ellen,
listening critically as she went on. He did not interrupt,
but when she had sounded the last notes he
said, “Let me give you one or two suggestions and
then you play it over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen obeyed, carefully following out his directions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better, much better,” he cried as the last notes
died away. “Good enough for any wedding party
that is likely to hear it in this church. Now I have a
proposition to make to you. For years I have wanted
to go to the Bach Festival at Bethlehem. This year it
seemed that all was favorable for me to go. It would
be a sad disappointment to me if I were to miss it. I
should have to be away two or three days, and just at
the last I am informed that a wedding will take place
in the church on one of those very days when I should
be absent. Now, then, my dear, I want you to do
me the favor of taking my place. You can do it perfectly
well. I have trained you on the Lohengrin
music with this in view, and now we have the Mendelssohn
march quite ready. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. Todd, do you really think I can do it
well enough?” Ellen was quite overcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly you can. In the first place there will
be no musical critics present, and in the second place
no one will notice anything but the wedding party.
You might play execrably and it would make no difference
so long as there was an approach to the familiar
strains. I will see that some one is at hand to tell
you when to begin and when to stop, so you won’t
be flustered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know I would do almost anything for you,
Mr. Todd,” said Ellen earnestly, “and if you think
I can do it well enough and won’t get panicky I’ll try
my best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good girl! Now then, I want you to know that
you will be doing not only a great favor to me, but
you will be earning five dollars, for that is what is
paid for the music.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but, Mr. Todd, I couldn’t take any money
when I am simply acting in your place; besides, see
how much in your debt I am already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense, nonsense! There is no question of
debt. I have enjoyed our lessons more than I can
tell you, and am I to be paid for receiving pleasure?
No, no, that is out of the question. Moreover, I shall
stay at home unless you are willing to make this a
matter of business. Do you want to deprive me of
that which I have longed for during all these years?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, I don’t want that; of course I don’t; I
want you to go. I’ll not do anything to keep you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it’s settled. You take my place and I go to
the festival with joy. It will be one of the happiest
experiences of my life. Now I will tell you that I
hoped for this long ago, when you first asked me to
think of some way in which you could earn money.
Perhaps you have wondered why I have been so particular
about these wedding marches. I wanted to
prepare you for some such occasion. Now I am perfectly
satisfied that you will do me credit, and I can
go off with a clear conscience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can I thank you? It is perfectly wonderful,”
said Ellen with shining eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is wonderful for me. Now, how are you going
to spend the money? You have said that you longed
to do something for Rindy. What is it to be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A party. She shall have a birthday party. She
has never had one in her life. Of course it can’t be a
very stylish affair, but it will be in June, rose time,
and there will be flowers to dress up the house with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All you want from our bushes. Great scheme,
Ellen. I’ll help all I can.” It was just the sort
of thing to appeal to Jeremy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We mustn’t let her know till the last minute, or
she will throw cold water on the plan. She will say
it is extravagant, and I mustn’t spend money on her.
But is it extravagant to do her honor, to give her a
good time when she has never had any? Is it foolish,
Mr. Todd?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not, and you will be giving others a good
time, too, so the circle widens. I approve heartily.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So from this time on Ellen began to scheme. She
made out her list of invitations and went around to
deliver them herself. “It is a sort of surprise party,”
she told Miss Rindy’s friends; “at least she is not to
know about it till the day. I am giving her the party
for a birthday present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are? Well, I call that real nice of you,” said
Mrs. Todd, who was the first to be approached. “I
don’t suppose you’d mind if I sent in a birthday cake,
would you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, indeed. I’d be only too delighted to
have it. Thank you very much indeed, Mrs. Todd,
for thinking of it. You are sure it won’t be too much
trouble for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it will be a pleasure. Now Jeremy is away
I only have myself to cook for, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gist of the matter was that by the time Ellen
had concluded her rounds no less than six birthday
cakes had been promised, while Maria Perry asked if
she didn’t want some pretty little candies to set off her
table, and Mrs. Hale offered to make a fruit punch,
herself supplying the fruit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly do want to help all I can,” said this
lady. “You say you are going to have ice-cream.
Are you going to buy it or make it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall have to buy it,” Ellen told her, “for in
the first place I don’t know how to make it, and then
we haven’t such a thing as a freezer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hale considered the matter for a moment. “I
tell you what you can do,” she said. “Make it over
here. Lucilena makes fine ice-cream, and she’d love
to help. We have a great big freezer which can be
kept here and taken over when you’re ready for it.
I’ll order the ice and things for you, and that will let
you out of that much trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How good you are,” cried Ellen gratefully.
“Every one is so kind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s mighty little to do for Miss Rindy,” declared
Mrs. Hale. “She’s always doing something for the
rest of us, but never lets us do anything for her. I
shall never forget how good she was to us when Billy
had diphtheria. I believe she saved his life. Oh, no,
you mustn’t think it counts for anything to do this
little bit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having made all her arrangements for the party,
Ellen next turned her attention to her music for the
wedding. It was an ordeal, but she meant to meet it
bravely, and so she did. It was a noon affair, but
not a stylish one. The bride was a simple little country
girl, the bridegroom a young farmer, but a church
wedding they must have, flowers on the altar and the
conventional music. Ellen acquitted herself creditably,
saw the bridal party depart amid showers of rice,
and passed out to be clasped by Caro.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Ellen,” cried this devoted friend, “I was so
thrilled. To think it was you playing the wedding
march! Now, I want you to promise on your sacred
word of honor that you will play for me when I get
married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it a little early to plan for that?” inquired
Ellen laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe it is,” returned Caro with perfect
seriousness, “but I want to be sure of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Evidently you think I’m a slippery sort of person,”
returned Ellen teasingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, you know I don’t think that, but it will
be such a lovely thing to look forward to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your wedding, or my performance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop teasing,” said Caro, giving her a gentle shake.
“What are you going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am going home to haul over the things in one
of my mother’s trunks. Cousin Rindy has got to have
something to wear to her party. I have told every
one to dress up in her best, but, dear me, you know
what Cousin Rindy’s best is. She hasn’t even the
plainest sort of white frock to her name, just some old
lawns and things, and I want to see her dressed up
for once in her life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think you can find to dress her up
in?” inquired Caro, who was deeply interested in the
coming event.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think there is a black lace dress of Mother’s
which will do. Dear Mother kept it to wear evenings
when she went out to sing. She disposed of all her
colored dresses when she went into mourning for my
father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what shall you wear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cousin Rindy has made over for me the only white
dress that Mother had. Dear Mother had worn out
most of the other things, so there wasn’t much left
that could be used, but I’m pretty sure of the black
lace, and I think Cousin Rindy can wear it just as it
is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am just crazy to see how she will look. When
are you going to tell her, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not till the very day. You mustn’t fail me, Caro.
You know you are to help serve the refreshments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fail you? I never was more excited in my life.
I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Every one is talking
about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope to goodness they won’t let the cat out of
the bag. I do want to keep it a secret up to the very
day. Cousin Rindy is capable of balking if you give
her time to think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The lace dress was discovered to be in quite as
good order as Ellen had hoped. It was shaken out
and hung up in her clothespress, to be ready for the
great day.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was mid-June. There was no school to think
of, for the summer holidays had begun. Mr. Todd
had returned long since from his outing, uplifted because
of the good time he had had, meeting old friends,
talking with kindred spirits, and, above all, listening
to such music as he had not heard since his student
days. “Some day you must go,” he told Ellen as he
ended his account of his experiences.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be a long time before I arrive at a proper
appreciation of Bach,” Ellen told him, “and still
longer before I can afford such a jaunt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One never knows,” returned her friend. “I was
a long time saving enough for the journey, and could
never have indulged myself in such extravagance if a
friend had not made it possible by inviting me to
stay with him. However, my child, as I said, one
never knows. There may be a perfect rush of
weddings when your services will be required at the
organ.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed, I shall not take your place again. I
feel guilty, as it is, to have accepted your fee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You earned it, and did mighty well, I hear. It
won’t do to say you will never do it again; I might
have lumbago.” And he went off chuckling.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long before this Ellen had lost all awe of her cousin.
At first, depressed, lonely, grief-stricken, she had
shown only a meek spirit. She did not know what
kindness, justice, and good sense lay behind Miss
Rindy’s abrupt manner, but in time she found out, her
spirits revived, and she teased, cajoled, made enthusiastic
appeals, just as she had done in her own
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the morning of Miss Rindy’s birthday she began
her manœuvres at the breakfast table. “I hope you
don’t forget that this is your birthday,” she said.
“Now, would you rather I kissed you once a minute
for three-quarters of an hour, or will you take a kiss
once a day for forty-six days?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ridiculous girl! You know what I think
about kissing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the reason I asked. I didn’t know but you
would rather have it over at once than prolong the
agony.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see the necessity of doing either.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to do something to celebrate, so I
thought that might appeal to you as being a cheap way
of getting out of it. If you object to that form of
celebration, what do you say to a party?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A party, indeed! What are you talking about?
I never had a party in my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it’s high time you had, and I mean that you
shall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do, do you? I suppose you mean to furnish
party dresses, refreshments, decorations, and all
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where, may I ask, do you expect to get the
money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I have money enough. Five dollars should
cover the expense of the modest entertainment I have
in mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five dollars, and where did you get five dollars?”
Miss Rindy leaned forward with real eagerness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Earned it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Playing wedding marches for Miss Matilda Andrews’
wedding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t mean to say they paid you for that?
I thought you did it as a favor so Jeremy could go
to that musical thing he was so set upon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He called it a favor, but I was paid just the
same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to give it right back to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tried to, but he won’t take it, so to ease my
conscience I am going to blow it in on a party for
you, which he can enjoy as well as the rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is a perfectly absurd and ridiculous notion.
You need shoes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can get along with those I have, or wear a pair
of Mother’s if I stuff cotton in the toes. If worst
comes to worst, I can go to one of those communities
where they run around barefoot for their health’s sake.
Now, Cousin Rindy, I don’t mind those disapproving
looks one little bit. I’ve made all my arrangements.
In a few minutes I expect the first birthday cake to be
delivered. The invitations are all out; I hope you
will approve of the list. The cakes are baked, or will
be before the morning is over, so this evening you must
be ready to receive your guests. I don’t believe you
will be so cruel as to disappoint them and me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy’s usually firm lips began to quiver.
“But Ellen, but Ellen——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ellen me no Ellens. Unless you want me to die
of mortification you will succumb gracefully.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks as if I must,” Miss Rindy sighed half
wistfully. “But I have nothing suitable to wear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, you have. When we have finished the
breakfast dishes we will go up-stairs and try it on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” Miss Rindy’s curiosity really was
aroused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That black lace of Mother’s. I am sure it will
fit you, or at least, made as it is, you can wear it. I
want you to take it as a birthday gift from me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not do it. You will need it yourself some
day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you consider black lace suitable for a chit of
a girl? By the time I could wear it, firstly, it would
be all out of style; secondly, it will have turned brown
or green from lying away; and thirdly, it may drop to
pieces from the same cause. Now be a nice, good
child and do this for me. I want you to wear, too, that
pretty bead chain thing one of your soldier boys made,
and sent you last Christmas. You never would wear
it, and now’s your chance. It will set off your dress
beautifully, and with a rose or two you will look like
a queen. Don’t dawdle over your food, Orinda; there
is a lot to be done, and we must get on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I declare, Ellen,” Miss Rindy began as she took
up her knife and fork again, but she stopped short, and
looked so pathetically meek that Ellen felt like laughing,
telling herself that her cousin stood bossing pretty
well.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rest of the day Miss Rindy acted like one in a
daze. The dress was found to suit perfectly, although
at first Miss Rindy insisted that she had never worn
anything so low in the neck, and that it must be fastened
up close to her chin, as she never wore anything
in any other way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it is high time you did,” insisted Ellen, still
bossy. “Any one with such a pretty white throat
should show it. My conscience, Cousin Rindy! Nobody
could call that anything but modest in the extreme.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I shall be so conscious and uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll be mighty comfortable on a hot day like
this, and if it should happen that you sink through
the floor with shame I’ll get the rector to go down into
the cellar and bring you up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do talk the most utter nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every one talks nonsense when they’re giving a
birthday party. I hope I won’t do anything perfectly
scan’lous before the day is over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not sure that you won’t,” returned Miss Rindy
grimly, “considering the way you have begun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That isn’t a circumstance to the way I shall end,”
retorted Ellen lightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to see that list of invitations,” Miss Rindy
changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall see it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you word your notes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like this: ‘Miss Ellen North’s compliments to
Mrs. So-and-So, and requests the pleasure of her company
on June fifteenth at eight o’clock in the evening
at a birthday party in honor of Miss Orinda Crump.’
Of course, it was rather formal, and as I took them
around myself I needn’t have written them, but could
have delivered my message in person, but I wanted to
be sure how many would accept, and then I didn’t
want them to forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody in this town would be likely to forget a
party at Rindy Crump’s,” was the comment, given
gruffly.</p>

<p class='c009'>There never was a more active person than Ellen
showed herself to be that day. She made the house
into a bower, she was “up-stairs, down-stairs, and in
my lady’s chamber,” so that every room was rose-sweet.
The cakes kept arriving up to the last minute,—even
Miss Sophia Garrett sent one,—and the bowl
of fruit punch was delivered safely, while the freezer
of ice-cream stood in readiness to be brought over by
Lucilena at the last moment. Mrs. Hale offered to
lend Lucilena for the occasion, that dusky person eagerly
seconding the offer. Wipers was dressed up in a
flaunting blue bow made from a discarded hair ribbon
of Caro’s; to be truthful one must relate that it was
torn to bits before midnight in an affray with Bunty,
but this did not prevent Wipers’ initial appearance
from being quite magnificent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hardest duty of the day was that of dressing
up Miss Rindy, who balked every step of the way.
“You must let me do your hair,” Ellen insisted at the
outset.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for?” asked Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I want it to be becoming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does well enough. I’ve always worn it this
way, and I don’t mean to change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just for this once; if you don’t like it you can
go back to the old way. Do you know I read somewhere
that a woman doesn’t begin to grow old till she
ceases to change the arrangement of her hair. I am
crazy to see how you will look when I am through
with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, go ahead, but I warn you that if I
don’t like it, down it comes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen went ahead. She waved, fluffed out, brought
down becoming locks over the high expanse of her
cousin’s forehead, and then giggled as she stood off to
see the effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose I do look like a perfect guy,” said Miss
Rindy, “so it’s no wonder you’re laughing at me.
Give me that hand mirror.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, you are not to see yourself till you are
all dressed. I was laughing because I’m so pleased at
the result of my efforts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t expect me to get dressed twice. How
can I do my hair with that fancy frock on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is just what I don’t expect. I guarantee that
you won’t want to take off the frock once you see how
well you look.” She slipped the dress over her cousin’s
head, fastened it, after many objections to the extremely
modest display of throat, finished it off with
an old-fashioned pin, swung the chain into place, then
turned her cousin around to face the large mirror.
“There,” she exclaimed, “how do you think you
look?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like a fool,” responded Miss Rindy with her twist
of a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Orinda Crump, I am ashamed of you! You know
perfectly well that you never looked so well in all your
life. You’d pass for no more than thirty-five at the
most. Will you have a dab of powder on your nose?
You won’t? Well, with your nice complexion you
really don’t need it. ’Fess up that you are pleased as
Punch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have to acknowledge, Ellen, that I never dreamed
that dress could make such a difference, and that I
suppose I am a vain old goose to be so pleased, but
what troubles me is what people will think. I know
what Sophy Bennett will say: ‘There’s no fool like an
old fool.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you care what she says or thinks? I’m
sorry I invited her if you think she’ll make you feel
uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She won’t, not any more than any one else. Let’s
go down, Ellen, before I get so puffed up looking
at myself in the glass that there’ll be no enduring
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the bell,” cried Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t leave me up here alone,” Miss Rindy called
after her, “for there is no knowing into what self-abasement
I may plunge. If I don’t rend my heart I
may rend my garments, so wait for me, and, once
having put my hand to the plough, I shall not dare to
turn back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen waited for her half-way down the stairs, and
together they greeted the first arrivals, these happening
to be Caro and her parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s good you happen to be the first, Sam Rowe,”
was Miss Rindy’s greeting to the doctor. “This is
my first party, you know, and I’m liable to faint dead
away from excitement, I’m in such a flutter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t look much as if you’d faint,” returned
the doctor. “I never saw you look so well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Rindy Crump,” Mrs. Rowe had been looking
her over, “what have you been doing to yourself?
You look ten years younger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t she?” the doctor agreed. “You’re almost
good-looking, Rindy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sh! Sh!” warned Miss Rindy. “Here come
some more people. I must compose my countenance.
If you don’t stop your compliments, I shall have a
rush of blood to the head, and then what? Go along,
Sam Rowe, and try out your flattery on some one
else, Sophy Bennett, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor made a wry face but moved on, and
soon Miss Rindy was surrounded by her guests.</p>

    <div>GETTING OUT OF DIFFICULTIES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Never had Rindy Crump’s old house witnessed
such gayety as it did that evening. Every one
seemed bound to give the hostess a good time.
Jeremy Todd brought his ’cello, Dr. Rowe contributed
his stock of funny stories, and Barry Hale did some
imitations which convulsed every one. The surprise
of the evening was when Ellen picked up Jeremy’s
violin. He had left it with her earlier in the day, and
he now accompanied her on the ’cello as she played a
lively gavotte. She looked very charming as she stood
in her simple white frock, with the violin tucked under
her chin, and she had at least one adorer in Caro, who
watched her ecstatically.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the applause had died away Caro rushed forward.
“Oh, Ellen,” she cried, “you never told me
you could play the violin. How accomplished you
are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “If you were but aware how little
I do know, you would never call me accomplished. I
knew a very little to begin with, and, as I have no
violin of my own, I have had no chance to practise,
but Mr. Todd has been good enough to instruct me
in this one piece and has lent me his violin so I could
do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nevertheless it was a very creditable performance,”
said the rector, coming up, “and has certainly
added to the pleasure of the evening. Your party is a
big success.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen felt that so far it was, but the refreshments
were yet to be served, and she could not be quite
happy till she was sure that these were all right. Time
was passing, and it now was the hour when she must
look to matters in the kitchen. Miss Rindy had promised
not to interfere, so Ellen felt the entire responsibility,
and was anxious. Suppose salt were to get
into the ice-cream, or a bat had fallen into the punch!
She voiced her fears to Caro as they left the front
room together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You certainly have a lively imagination,” declared
Caro. “I might have thought of the salt, but I never
could have thought of the bat. Do you want me to
serve the punch or just pass around things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Hale says she will serve the punch, so you
and Sally can pass around. Mrs. Todd is going to
help me with the ice-cream, and Lucilena is going to
wash up the glasses and things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you have managed everything wonderfully.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t give me the credit; it is chiefly due to the
neighbors, who have been so kind and helpful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Todd and Mrs. Hale both had followed the
girls into the kitchen. Lucilena had arrived, reporting
that she had left Billy sound asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll cut the cake,” offered Mrs. Todd, “while you
attend to the ice-cream, Marietta. The punch is all
ready, isn’t it? Lucilena can carry it in, can’t she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, indeed she can, and then she can open the
freezer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, and please don’t let her get salt in it,” begged
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hale laughed. “I can promise she won’t do
that; she has opened too many freezers to make a
mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen stood by, anxiously watching the process as
Lucilena removed the ice, carefully wiping the top of
the freezer before taking it off. Ellen peered interestedly
in at the contents. “It looks mighty good,”
she remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It bleedged to be,” responded Lucilena, picking
up a spoon and deftly whipping off a taste which she
put into her capacious mouth. “Jes’ sample it to see
if all right,” she explained. But immediately her expression
changed. “Law, Miss Mar’etta,” she cried,
“it got no mo’ flavah dan nothin’ ’tall. I done fergits
to put in dat bernilla. What we do ’bout it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O dear!” exclaimed Ellen in distress.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Todd came over to see if
Lucilena were really right about it. “It is as flat as
can be; I am so sorry,” said Mrs. Hale after critically
trying a spoonful. “I don’t know what we can do
about it; I suppose we shall have to serve it just as it
is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen looked ready to cry. After all her efforts, to
have such a thing happen was too much. Lucilena
stood, arms akimbo, head one side, looking down at
the freezer as if she expected a genie to appear and
set things right. Ellen, with clasped hands, gazed
pleadingly at Mrs. Todd, who looked aloft as she
spatted her hands together thoughtfully. Mrs. Hale
shook her head mournfully at Lucilena.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Mrs. Todd thought of the remedy. “Put
the cover back on the freezer, Lucilena,” she ordered.
“We can serve it with chocolate sauce and no one
will know the difference. It won’t take long to make
it. I’ll run over home and get the chocolate; I have
plenty.” She hurried off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen breathed a sigh of relief. This was a way
out, but again came a difficulty when Caro said: “But
every one doesn’t like chocolate sauce. I know my
father doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” Ellen again clasped her hands in dismay.</p>

<p class='c009'>But here Mrs. Hale, inspired by Mrs. Todd, came
to the rescue. “Don’t worry, Ellen,” she said; “we
can have strawberry sauce, too, for those that don’t
care for the chocolate. Run over, Lucilena, and get
that box of strawberries out of the refrigerator.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I don’t like to take your strawberries,”
protested Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s up to me to do what I can to correct the mistake,”
declared Mrs. Hale. “We can have some other
kind of fruit for breakfast as well as not. For my
own part I’ll enjoy the berries much more with the ice-cream.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Todd was back in no time with the chocolate,
and following her came Lucilena, the box of berries
in one hand, and sleepy Billy slung over her shoulder.
“He jes’ cryin’ pitably,” she explained, “t’arin’ his
mouf open an’ yellin’, ‘Daddy, Daddy! dey ain’t nobody
here to tek keer o’ me but angels, and it’s too
dark to see ’em.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The little dear,” murmured Ellen, as she carried
the child to his mother, who cuddled and comforted
him, though, with so many to take care of him, he
was soon broad awake and clamoring for ice-cream.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Mrs. Todd was busy making the chocolate
sauce the girls prepared the strawberries, and before
long everything was ready, the delay being scarcely
noticed by the guests. Then the girls scurried to the
front with plates and doilies, these last borrowed
from Mrs. Hale, and the ice-cream was served,
praised, and consumed without the least suspicion that
in its original form it lacked flavor. Most of the
cakes were delicious, though, to her mortification,
Miss Sophia Bennett’s was found to be “sad,” and
was set aside. Nobody missed it, however, for there
was an abundance without it.</p>

<p class='c009'>After all, Lucilena didn’t wash the dishes. She had
her fill of the refreshments, gave Billy more than was
good for him, then sat down and rocked him to sleep,
crooning over him, and once in a while taking a dip
from the saucer of ice-cream which she kept by her
side. At last, becoming sleepy herself, without further
concern she bore Billy off to his home, put him, sound
asleep, in his crib, and went to bed without a qualm
of conscience.</p>

<p class='c009'>So to the girls fell the task of washing the dishes,
but they made so merry over it that it brought from
the front room the last lingering guests, Doctor and
Mrs. Rowe, waiting for their daughter; the Hales, who
were to take home some of the “borrowings”; and
the Todds, who wanted to talk over matters with the
rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Rowe was the first to open the kitchen door
and peep in. “Here, here, what’s all this fun about?”
he exclaimed. “Let me in on it, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not unless you share the work,” said his daughter
saucily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to do it. Do I wear an apron? Am I to
wash or wipe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither,” Ellen told him. “We are in the thick
of it, and may as well finish. Are you willing to make
yourself useful in any old way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have but to command me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you can sort out those punch glasses and
put them carefully in that basket; they go back to the
Hales, that is, all those with the wall of Tyre decoration;
the others belong to Mrs. Todd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be sure you don’t break any, Daddy,” sang out
Caro. “You know what to expect from Mrs. Todd,
if you do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not in the least afraid of Bessie Todd,” the
doctor declared emphatically. “I’ve ordered her
about too many times in the past not to expect her to
stand in awe of me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that about Bessie Todd?” asked that person
appearing at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said I wasn’t afraid of you, but that I expected
you to be afraid of me,” retorted the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That day has passed,” replied Mrs. Todd.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better not be too sure. Wait till you get down
with an illness and see if you dare disobey my orders.
I wish you’d come here and finish this job. You
know better than I do which of these glasses belong
in your cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Todd was not unwilling, and the doctor turned
to Ellen, saying: “I have an understudy. What shall
I do now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen surveyed the room. “You see that cake over
there. You can eat what you can of it, and I will see
what can be done with the rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That cake? I’d as soon swallow a bullet. Do you
want me to die of acute indigestion? It’s as heavy as
lead, girl. Throw it away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Todd left the glasses and came over to regard
the cake critically. “It is rather heavy,” she commented,
“but the edges might be used in cabinet pudding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then please take it and make the pudding,” cried
the doctor, “but I will not be responsible for your
death or Jeremy’s. If I have a hurry call from you
to-morrow night, I shall know what remedies to
bring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Todd laughed. “I was going to invite you
to dinner, but now I shall not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good thing, too. Here, give me that broom, Ellen.
I’ll sweep up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With the many hands at work the kitchen was soon
in fair order, the last goodnights were said, and Ellen
was left alone with her cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We haven’t gone very far along with the kisses,”
she said. “At this rate we’ll never get to the forty-sixth.”
She put her arms around Miss Rindy and
kissed her. “How did you like your party? How
do you feel now that it is over?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel ten years younger, though I’m wondering
what the tongues will say when they go clacking to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What could they say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They could say vanity, extravagance, foolishness.
Why couldn’t they spend their money on something
sensible when they have so little of it? Why did old
Rindy Crump doll herself up like a sixteen-year-old?
Hadn’t she any better sense?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Cousin Rindy!” Ellen was really hurt. “I
don’t see why you should be so suspicious. I don’t
believe there was a person here who would say or even
think such things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe not. The fact of the matter is, Ellen,
that I have enjoyed myself so greatly that I feel sort of
queer about it, as if I hadn’t any right to. I told you
that I had never had a party in all my life, but I didn’t
tell you that it was something I always longed for
but never felt that I should afford. But when you
took the matter into your own hands I was weak
enough not to protest overmuch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You dear thing,” said Ellen, giving her a close
hug. “If you could have heard how everybody rejoiced
when I told them you were to have a party,
you could never think they disapproved. I never saw
more enthusiasm, nor such kind friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about Sophy Bennett and Bessie Todd?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor Miss Bennett came out into the kitchen to
see her cake cut, and was so mortified because it was
so heavy no one could think of eating it. I felt really
sorry for her. As for Mrs. Todd, well, things might
have fallen flatter than the cake if she hadn’t come to
the rescue.” Then Ellen told of the ice-cream episode,
ending up with: “And no one was the wiser. Indeed
I think the two kinds of sauce were a great addition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so myself. Wasn’t it just like that trifling
Lucilena to leave out something? It’s a mercy it
wasn’t sugar. I suppose she was of some use, however.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “I can’t remember that she did
anything but take the ice out of the freezer and go
after the strawberries. But, no matter, we all pitched
in, washed up the dishes, and had a lot of fun over it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel sort of condemned to have stood back and
let you have the entire responsibility as well as the
work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you promised, you know; besides, this was
your day, and——” Ellen paused, then she said with
a little laugh, “I don’t believe that all these good people
would have been so ready to contribute and to help
you if I hadn’t asked them, because, dear Lady Orinda,
you are a bit stand-offish, and are so proud and haughty
that you won’t let any one do things for you if you
can avoid it, while I am such a young and humble
little ‘creetur’ that I appeal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humble, are you? I haven’t seen much humility,
though I admit you are young.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’m growing older every minute. Just think,
it won’t be long before I am sixteen, and then what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what I’ve been thinking,” Miss Rindy
sighed. “If you are going to make music your profession,
you should have better opportunities than this
little town affords. You’ll never get anywhere living
always in this poky place. Jeremy says there isn’t a
doubt but you could make your way in the city, and
it is there you should go to study.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t let’s cross that bridge yet. Who knows
what may happen? It will be a long time before I
have learned all Mr. Todd can teach me; meanwhile
I am learning lots of other things, and am growing
fonder and fonder of the place, the people, and my
own home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy took her by the shoulders and looked
her straight in the eyes. “Then you aren’t unhappy,
Ellen. You are satisfied to be with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen took the two hands laid on her shoulders and
kissed first one and then the other. “Dear Cousin
Rindy,” she said, “I don’t know what I should have
done without you. Of course I was very unhappy at
first, while it was all so strange, and the time had
been so short since I had lost my dear ones. I would
have been unhappy anywhere and with any one, but
think what it is to have you, and Jeremy Todd, and
Caro, not to mention all the other dear people. I
have had to get used to the different way of looking
at things, the different standards, but it doesn’t matter
a particle now when they call me red-head, and think
buttonhole mouths and wasp waists and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“High foreheads,” put in Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it was hard to think that all those old-fashioned
standards of beauty were the correct ones. I
was sort of bewildered at first, because I had lived
with artists who don’t admire such things, but now I
don’t care, and there is no one in the world who is as
much to me as you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is a satisfaction to me. Well, Ellen, I reckon
we’ll hit it off pretty well as long as we are destined
to live together. When the time comes to separate, as
it must some day, neither of us will feel like chuckling,”
which was as near as Miss Rindy could come
to expressing her real affection. “Come along, now,”
she added, changing the subject abruptly, “it is long
past bedtime; we won’t want to get up in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They went up to their rooms. The scent of roses
and honeysuckle was wafted into their windows. Ellen
went to hers and knelt down to look up at the
quiet stars. “Dear Mother, dear Father,” she murmured,
“I hope that you can see me, and that you
know how good a home I have. It will comfort you
to know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then suddenly upon the balmy air of the June night
came the sound of music near, very near. Jeremy
Todd was playing on his violin directly under the windows.
Ellen ran to her cousin’s room. “Cousin
Rindy, Cousin Rindy,” she whispered, “do you hear?
It is Mr. Todd, and he is serenading you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now isn’t that just like Jeremy Todd to do a
sentimental thing like that? The end of a perfect day,
I suppose he’d call it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But isn’t that just what it is?” said Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes, I suppose it is; it’s the end, anyway.”
She did not object, however, to kneeling down with
Ellen by the open window into which the light from
a half moon streamed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it lovely?” sighed Ellen, as Jeremy, with a
high, fine, long-drawn note, finished what he was playing.
Then he began the air of one of the Schumann
songs. Ellen leaned out to toss a rose to the serenader.
“Troubadour, troubadour,” she called, “I’m
coming down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why in the world do you want to do that?” inquired
Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll show you when I get down there. Now
please do stay just where you are. I won’t be gone
very long. Please stay, Cousin Rindy.” And Miss
Rindy stayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen ran out upon the moonlit grass plot where
intricate shadows were swaying. She said something
in a low tone to Jeremy, and he tuned his violin anew.
Then upon the quiet night arose Ellen’s sweet, fresh
voice in the song her mother loved, Schumann’s
“Moonlight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was well done,” said Mr. Todd as the last
note died away. “When you are a little older, your
voice should be cultivated, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen shook her head. “We can’t talk about that
now. I think Cousin Rindy has had a perfectly fine
birthday, don’t you, Mr. Todd? And it was so dear
of you to finish it up with the lovely music, like a
good-night blessing, wasn’t it? I am sure Cousin
Rindy enjoyed it, though she may not say so, and I’m
not quite sure that she would understand ‘Moonlight.’
I felt that I must sing it—for Mother. On this lovely
night she seems so near.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think she is,” responded Mr. Todd. “The music
was for you, Ellen, as much as for Miss Rindy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew that as soon as you began. I must go in.
Cousin Rindy will think I am crazy to stay out so
long. Good-night, and thank you, thank you, thank
you for the serenade.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She ran in to find Miss Rindy had arisen from her
knees and was taking down her hair and preparing
for bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever have a serenade before?” asked
Ellen. “How did you like it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, pretty well. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard
Jeremy scraping on his fiddle. You’ve got a right
pretty voice, Ellen, but I can’t say there was much
tune to the thing you sang. What was it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is called ‘Moonlight,’ and this seemed just the
time to sing it. Mother loved it. I thought she’d
like me to sing it for you on your birthday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe so, maybe so. Well, Ellen, it’s high time
you were in bed. Trot along.” Then she took the
girl in her arms and gave her a warm kiss, a most
unusual thing for Rindy Crump to do.</p>

    <div>ONCE MORE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was at a church picnic that Ellen discovered who
had sent her the flowers at Christmas and she reported
her discovery to Miss Rindy that evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who was that walking home with you?” asked
Miss Rindy, who had been on the watch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Ives,” returned Ellen promptly. “He was
real nice to me at the picnic, and insisted on carrying
my basket home, though, goodness knows, it wasn’t
heavy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph!” was Miss Rindy’s only comment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, Cousin Rindy, I found out who sent me the
flowers last Christmas; it was Frank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy gave her a keen look, but there was no
conscious expression on the girl’s face. “I don’t have
much use for those Iveses,” came the comment. “They
were poor trash before the war, and now that they
have plenty of money they are insufferable in my
opinion. The father made his money in the war,
cheating the government, I’m told, and they have
splurged out and put on airs till I can’t stand the sight
of them. The girl’s a painted doll, and the mother
isn’t much better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank seems rather jolly,” Ellen defended, “and
rather like his name,—frank, you know, and not a bit
airish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know anything about the boy, but I’d
advise you to keep clear of the whole outfit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>However, Ellen did not find this easy to do. A
crowd of merry young people were in the habit of
gathering every evening at Dr. Rowe’s, and, leaving
her cousin to hobnob with some of her cronies, Ellen
would slip out and run down to Caro, who always met
her with open arms. Knowing that Miss Rindy had
not the slightest objection to this acquaintance, Ellen
felt free to visit Caro whenever she wished. Frank
would bring his guitar, and Clyde Fawcett his
mandolin. Ellen would lead the singing, and, though
the music was not of the highest order, being chiefly
about bananas, Alabama coons, and such foolishness,
they all enjoyed it, mainly because it was team work
and brought forth youthful laughter and merry jokes.
Frank fell into the habit of walking home with Ellen,
the two always followed by the statement “I was seeing
Nellie home,” sung vociferously by those left behind.
Frank was a tall, slim youth of eighteen, inclined to be
sentimental, lazy, and pleasure loving. One could
hardly blame him for cultivating these traits when he
had an over-indulgent mother and a father who
thought of little except increasing his bank account,
and who never checked his children in the pursuit of
any of their inclinations, a course not likely to develop
strength of character.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen was not long in discovering the fact that
Frank was rather a weak brother, but, in spite of this,
she liked his evident admiration, and felt flattered that
he had selected her above the other girls as the object
of his attentions. She was known as “Hazy,”
by the rest of the crowd, because Clyde had overheard
Frank telling her that she should be called Hazel because
of the color of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Clyde was a good-natured, practical lad, always joking,
making puns, and telling absurd stories. There
were sure to be laughter and nonsense where Clyde was,
so he was always in demand. Innocent fun it was,
and very good for Ellen, who had lived too much with
older persons. Miss Rindy, fine as she was, nevertheless
did not think she was doing her duty unless she
kept her young charge constantly reminded of the
necessity of being useful, and of these reminders Ellen
wearied many a time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t help thinking of Cousin Rindy when
they sang that hymn this morning,” she said to Jeremy
as they were walking home from church one day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What hymn?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That one which says, ‘Direct, control, suggest this
day all I design or do or say,’” Ellen told him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He smiled, then chuckled. “Rindy certainly does
like to suggest, and isn’t over pleased when you don’t
take her suggestions, but then she isn’t the only one
who is built that way,” and Ellen knew he was thinking
of his own wife, especially when he went on: “There
are worse things than being bossed, and one can be
thinking one’s own thought during the process of
bossing. That is one thing that saves us, Ellen; nobody
can control our thoughts.” And Ellen nodded
understandingly. After all her lot was an easier one
by far than was Jeremy Todd’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>The long summer days sped all too rapidly. Ellen
learned to can, preserve, and pickle, to cultivate vegetables,
to do many housewifely things. She sometimes
grew impatient under her cousin’s constant suggestions.
There was but one way to do a thing, in Miss Rindy’s
opinion, and that was her way. But when the situation
became too hard for Ellen she always found a
refuge in Jeremy, to whom she would unburden herself,
and from whom she always received comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would do you good to get away for a little
while,” he said to her one day when Miss Rindy had
been unusually sharp. “A change always clears the
atmosphere. It is good for those who go and for
those who stay behind. Are there none of your friends
in the city with whom you would like to spend
a few days?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are several to whom I should like to go,
but I have not been invited, in the first place, and then
I don’t feel that I should leave Cousin Rindy. Moreover,
I’d need new clothes, and where would my railway
ticket come from? Oh, no, I have no reason to
complain, and I do not exactly; I am just spilling over
a little. You are always so beautifully ready to understand,
and you don’t go off and repeat what I say.
You are a great refuge, Mr. Jeremy Todd.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well that some one finds me so,” he returned
rather grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen ran off to the post-office and brought back the
daily paper and one letter for Miss Rindy, which she
took and read in silence. Then she sat for a few
moments gazing thoughtfully out of the window.
Ellen meantime was looking over the paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently her cousin turned to her and said, “Ellen,
how would you like to spend your Christmas in the
city with some of your old friends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like it immensely, but there would be my
travelling expenses, and I’d hate to go without some
new clothes.” Strange that Jeremy Todd should have
mentioned the same plan. “Don’t think I mind wearing
my old ones here,” she added quickly, “but I
haven’t anything very nice for evenings, you know,
and my serge suit is getting pretty shabby; I have worn
it so much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is true; I hadn’t thought about the clothes,
and I’m afraid we couldn’t afford both clothes and
ticket.” Miss Rindy sighed. “Everything is so
much higher nowadays that one’s income doesn’t cover
more than half what it used to, and the income doesn’t
increase with the price of other things. Well, we’ll
say no more about it, but just settle down and have our
holidays here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But, as it turned out, there was a great deal more
to be said about it. During the next few days Miss
Rindy was rather short and grumpy, railing against
high prices, the United States government, and things
in general. Just why she was in this bitter mood Ellen
could not find out, but it did not make for any great
happiness on her part, for it increased her sense of
dependence. “Never mind, Cousin Rindy,” she said
one day when there had been a particularly sharp
tirade against conditions, “I’ll soon be old enough
to make my own living, and perhaps I may be able to
help you, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy turned on her. “Don’t you ever say
such a thing again. As if I were flinging at you. The
thing that troubles me is that I can’t give you everything
I’d like to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, think what you do give me——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not another word. Go down and see if there is
any mail.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen went off, and in a short time was back, lugging
a large box.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What in the world have you there?” inquired
Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just what I don’t know. It is addressed
to me, and Mrs. Perry said that as I was the only
Ellen North in town it must be for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who sent it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one that I know. Up in the corner it says
it is from Mary West, Baltimore, and I don’t know
any Mary West in Baltimore or anywhere else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Open it and we may find some explanation inside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is fairly heavy,” said Ellen. Then she lifted
the box to a chair and began tugging at the string,
finally loosening it enough to remove the cover. There
was a layer of tissue paper on top but nothing in the
way of a card or note. Underneath the paper, carefully
wrapped in a towel, was a white crêpe de Chine
dress. Ellen shook it out and looked at her cousin in
wonderment. “Did you ever?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy took the dress and began examining it
while Ellen turned her attention to the next thing in
the box. This was discovered to be a black wool dress
with touches of white embroidery upon it; then came
a black sport hat with a white ornament upon it, and,
last of all, there was a black coat with a big fur collar.
At sight of this last Ellen was so overcome that she
flung the coat from her and dropped in a heap on the
floor while she burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You silly, silly goose,” cried Miss Rindy. “Get
up. What in the world are you crying for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so afraid they don’t belong to me, and they
are so lovely,” Ellen sobbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Find another Ellen North in the town and I’ll
admit that they might not belong to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there isn’t another, Mrs. Perry said so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then stop fussing and take the gifts the gods
send you. Try on this coat. The things aren’t quite
new, but they are just as good, and of finer quality
than I could afford. Whoever sent them must have
known that it was time you lightened your mourning,
for they are exactly right. The coat is a little long,
but that can soon be remedied, and the hat looks fine
with it. We’d better take everything up-stairs, and
you can try on the dresses. My, Ellen, but that box
certainly is a godsend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the only one I can thank for it is God, because
I don’t know any Mary West.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I wouldn’t bother about it. Probably some
of your city friends or some old friend of your mother’s
has heard about you, and thought this would be a
nice, thoughtful way of serving you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen accepted this explanation, although it was not
the right one, and went up to try on the dresses, which,
with some alterations, Miss Rindy declared would do
perfectly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I declare,” she said, “if I had picked them out
myself I couldn’t have done better. Now you are all
ready for the city,” she added with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I haven’t been invited.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought you said you had a standing invitation
from that Mrs. Austin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I had, but it might not be convenient just at
this time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better write and find out; that’s easy to do. What
about that Mr. Barstow, your father’s friend?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he is an old bachelor and has a Japanese servant
to look after him. He has a most beautiful studio
apartment, but of course I couldn’t go there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not, but you could go somewhere,
couldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to me you are very anxious to get rid
of me,” said Ellen laughing. “Do you want to get me
out of the way so as to do some weird stunt which
would make me lose my respect for you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I can tell you the real reason, now that
the way has cleared for you to go in proper raiment.
I had a letter the other day from my friend, Bertha
Martin. We were buddies over there in France, and
there is no one I like better. Well, she married before
we left, and I was her bridesmaid, the first and
only time I ever served in that capacity. She has
been begging me to come to see her. Now she is in her
own home, and is bent and determined that I should
spend Christmas with her, and I confess, Ellen, that
I am crazy to go. It wouldn’t cost any more than
our keep here, you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you were going to stay at home because of
me. Oh, Cousin Rindy! I could go to Caro or somebody.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hadn’t thought of that, and besides I’m not going
to have you make a convenience of any one.
You’d rather go to the city, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’ll try to fix it up. I’ll write to Bertha
to-day, and you can write to your friend, Mrs.
Austin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ellen decided that it would be better to consult
Mr. Barstow, who, as an intimate friend of the Austins,
could tell her if a visit would be acceptable to the
latter. An answer came by return mail; Ellen was
to come right along. Mrs. Austin was writing to
urge her not to fail them. They would have a jolly
time. Mr. Barstow himself was planning all sorts of
things. She wasn’t to fuss over a holiday outfit; they
could dress her up in studio properties and call her a
lay figure or a model or something like that.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cheery, cordial letter was very heartening.
Once more would Ellen have a share in those things
which she loved, in the unconventional way of living,
the informal parties, the free-and-easy companionship.
The letter from Mrs. Austin gave assurance that she
was very much wanted, and she began her preparations
with a light heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy was almost as excited as Ellen. “I’ll
get those frocks altered in short order,” she said. “I
think we’d better go over your mother’s trunks and
see if there is anything in them that would be useful
to you in the city. Now that you are sixteen, Ellen,
things would be suitable for you that wouldn’t have
been a year or more ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what about you? Surely you have something
to do for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You certainly need a new hat, Cousin Rindy.
Aren’t you going to get one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I am not. Do you think I’m made of money?
If Bertha Martin doesn’t like me in my old hat, she can
let me alone. She has seen me in a worse rig than
any I’m likely to appear in now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are going to take your lace dress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’ll take that, although I always feel guilty
about wearing it when I think that you may need it
some day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That I never shall. Long before I am old enough
to wear it I hope to be able to buy all sorts of splendor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very optimistic, I must confess. If you
can provide yourself with one decent dress a year,
you’ll be doing well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why discourage me in my high hopes? Thoreau
says it is all right to build castles in the air if later you
put foundations under them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph! I suppose that is some of Jeremy Todd’s
talk; sounds like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen did not reply to this, but went up to the attic
to look over the trunks. She found a scarf which she
decided would make a fine addition to Miss Rindy’s
wardrobe, and which would do for a Christmas gift
from herself. An ostrich-feather fan she appropriated,
and a pair of opera glasses, but these were the
only things which she felt would be suitable.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the time she was rummaging she was thinking
about her Cousin Rindy’s hat. “If it were not for
paying my travelling expenses she could get one,” Ellen
told herself. “I really think I ought to give up
my visit and go to Caro’s instead; she wants awfully
to have me at Christmas, but, oh, dear! I think I
shall pine away if I have to stay here when I am just
crazy to get back with that dear old crowd; and yet—and
yet—— If I had only promised Caro in the
first place, I couldn’t get out of it, and Cousin Rindy
could have her visit and a hat, too. Sometimes it is
mighty hard to be unselfish. Cousin Rindy never
thinks of herself, but I am not so good as she is, and I
never shall be.” She sighed, arose from her knees,
locked the trunk, and took the things she had selected
from it down to her room, but she went around with
a soberly thoughtful countenance the rest of the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>As usual in such cases she took her dilemma to
Jeremy Todd. “I’m all fussed up,” she told him. “I
don’t feel as if I could possibly allow Cousin Rindy to
pay my travelling expenses, and yet I am wild to go
to Mrs. Austin’s. If I could only make some excuse
to stay here and let Cousin Rindy go, I’d do it, I
really would. You needn’t look at me in that quizzical
way, Mr. Jeremy Todd. What are you laughing
at?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For Mr. Todd was beginning to chuckle, and the
chuckle was growing into a hearty laugh. “I am
laughing because things turn out in such a funny manner
sometimes. You may not think you were born
under a lucky star, you little Ellen North, but I believe
you were.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What makes you say that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You remember the birthday party, don’t you?
Well, a similar condition has arisen. I was called up
this very morning by a man in Meadowville,—you
remember the little church there. I am wanted to
play for a wedding, but as there is to be a wedding in
our own church at the same hour, noon, I was thinking
of asking you to take the music here while I go to
Meadowville. How does the idea strike you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. Todd, it strikes me so hard that I am
nearly knocked flat. It seems like a miracle only——”
She stopped short, and the joy died out of her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter now, sprained your thumb, or
what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, I’m not incapacitated, but I told you last
time that I was not going to take your place unless you
received what is rightfully yours, the fee.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So just for a matter of silly pride you would
throw away a good five dollars which I could not
have anyhow, since I cannot be in two places at the
same time. I thought better of you, Ellen North, after
all Rindy Crump’s training. All right, I’ll get Sophy
Bennett to give the music here; she will never refuse
the fee, I can assure you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Mr. Todd, don’t get her; she plays so execrably.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody else; it must be you or her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I give in. I accept the offer gratefully. A
great load is lifted. Thank you a thousand times.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t thank me. It is purely a matter of accommodation.
I shall have a much better time at the
Meadowville wedding. They will make much of me,
and will invite me to the wedding feast, something I
should not expect here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is the date? I forgot to ask.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A week before Christmas. The bridal couple in
each case want to take a wedding trip, and be back in
time to celebrate Christmas at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen gave a long sigh of satisfaction. “I was
born under a lucky star, I do believe,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>So after all Ellen paid her own travelling expenses,
Miss Rindy had a new hat, and both started off in
high feather after locking up the house and leaving
Wipers to the tender mercies of the Dove-Hales.</p>

    <div>STUDIO DOINGS</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>“So here we have our little girl back again,” cried
Mr. Barstow as he came gaily into the Austins’
studio on the evening of Ellen’s arrival. “Welcome
back to the old ‘haunches,’ as old Potter used to say.
Let’s look at you. Grown? I should say so. Almost
a young lady, but she keeps her lovely coloring, doesn’t
she, Mrs. Austin? Now sit down here and tell us all
that you have been doing down there in the country.
Milking the cows, feeding the pigs, and all that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve fed nothing but the cat, and I haven’t learned
to milk, but I can do a lot of other things.” She ran
over a list of her accomplishments in the domestic line.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Cæsar! they certainly have been keeping you
at it. Good thing, though. When Kogi gets obstreperous
I’ll know where to send for a cook. I tell
you what we’ll do; we’ll have a spree at my studio some
day. I’ll send Kogi off, and you and Mrs. Austin can
come over and cook all over the place. What do you
consider your chef-d’œuvre?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can make a pretty good omelet, and Cousin Rindy
has shown me how to prepare some of the dishes she
learned about over in France.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine! We’ll count on the omelet, and you can
think up the other things meanwhile. We’re going to
celebrate at my studio on Christmas Eve, you know.
All the old crowd will be there, and we shall do our
prettiest to have some fun. Now I must be off. Don’t
forget, Connie, Christmas Eve. Come early.” He
put his head over the top of the screen behind which
Mrs. Austin was at work, waved his hand to Ellen,
and dashed out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I come see what you are doing?” asked Ellen
as the door closed behind Mr. Barstow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” answered Mrs. Austin. “I am finishing
your Christmas gift, and wouldn’t have you see it for
the world. I must take advantage of the daylight, you
know, and there is so little left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A Christmas gift for me! Oh, Mrs. Austin, you
shouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because this visit is a fine enough present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, don’t you see, you are giving me the visit,
and I must do something for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is one way to look at it,” Ellen answered.
“According to my point of view it is I who receive
from you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, never mind, don’t let’s talk about it. You’ll
get me all fussed up. You go find a book or something
to amuse you. There are some magazines over
on the big table. When Phil comes in we’ll decide
whether we’ll have a delicatessen dinner here or go
out somewhere. Make yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This delightful lack of ceremony exactly suited Ellen.
She wandered around the room for a few minutes,
looked at the sketches on the walls, and finally
curled herself up on a big couch by the window, to
look out upon the familiar streets. One by one the
lights flashed out from the tall buildings and from the
street lamps, then brilliant signs began to appear,
crowds hurried home, elevated trains rumbled along
near by, automobiles honked, the siren of a fire engine
wailed its warning, while Ellen’s thoughts travelled
back to the dear departed days of which all these sights
and sounds only too vividly reminded her. She covered
her face with her hands as the tears began to
gather.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently Mrs. Austin came and sat down beside
her. She drew her close. “I know, little girl, I
know. It is very hard, but we want to give you such
a good time while you are here that you will remember
that rather than the sad time back of it. We are all
such busy people that you may have thought we were
forgetting you, but we haven’t forgotten, and we are
always going to keep you in our hearts. There comes
Phil; let’s see what he wants to do about dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Austin came in laden with packages. He was
a tall, spare man with near-sighted brown eyes, a
pointed Vandyke beard, sandy hair, and a nervous
mouth. He had an absent-minded way of looking at
you as if he saw not you but a vision. He had met
Ellen at the train, delivered her to his wife, and then
had gone off to his club.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought it would be rather nice to have a snack
here,” he said as he laid the packages on the table. “I
was away down-town on Fulton Street to look at that
work of Kean’s, so I went over to that Spanish place
and got some of those things you like, Connie,—that
nougat stuff, and some dandy little cakes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cakes and candy won’t make a very hearty dinner
for Ellen, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, bless you, child, I got those at the Spanish
grocer’s, I told you. Then on my way from the subway
I loaded up at the delicatessen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a good child, Phil. I don’t know what I
should do without you. Let’s see what you have.
Sliced ham, cheese, potato salad, rolls, canned
peaches;” she mentioned the articles as she drew them
forth from the big bag. “I’ll open a can of soup, and
we shall do very well. If we get hungry before bedtime,
we can have a cup of chocolate. You and
Ellen can set the table, Phil, while I get the soup
ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Austin swept the books and papers from the
largest table, and laid some queer-looking mats upon
it while Ellen went for the dishes. There were no
two of these alike, and when it came time to serve the
peaches the soup plates had to be washed, as there
was nothing else in which to put them. However,
they had a jolly meal and Ellen enjoyed the informality.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does so remind me of the old days,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought it might, and that you would like it,”
said Mr. Austin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we don’t mean that you shall always eat in
this higgledy-piggledy way,” declared Mrs. Austin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s fun, and I like it,” Ellen assured her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dishes were scarcely out of the way before visitors
from the neighboring studios dropped in, and the
familiar art patter began. One or more brought
sketches which were set up and commented upon with
much gesture of thumbs and heated discussion. Ellen
listened to it all with glowing appreciation, and when
the talk became an exchange of witticisms, she withdrew
herself farther and farther away from the dull
little town she had left. This was the life. Nobody
had such good times as these care-free artists.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later Mrs. Austin made chocolate and brought out
the cakes and nougat, which were consumed to the
uttermost crumb. There were not enough cups for
the chocolate, but anything did,—tumblers, mugs, even
two small pitchers,—and as for spoons, who wanted
them when there were clean sticks of charcoal handy?</p>

<p class='c009'>It was nearly midnight before the company dispersed,
and then Ellen was put to bed on the couch,
her coverings eked out by a Navajo blanket taken
down from the wall, and she went to sleep with the
moonlight streaming in through the skylight, picking
out the gilt on the hilts of a pair of swords, and causing
the glass eyes of a simpering lay figure to stare
at her uncannily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Austin was in hiding behind the screen most
of the next day, but she emerged in time to scramble
together some sort of lunch made up of the odds and
ends left over from the night before. Mr. Austin was
out nearly all day, so Ellen, left to herself, sallied
forth to hunt up some of her old friends. She was
so late getting back that she found Mr. and Mrs. Austin
waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We feared you were lost,” said Mrs. Austin.
“We thought we’d go somewhere and get a light
supper. Mr. Barstow is sure to have a big feast in the
course of the evening, so we must save our appetites
for that. Are you going to wear that dress, Ellen?
If you are not, skurry into another one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We should dress up, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, this is a gala occasion. Put on your very
flossiest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen, eager to wear the white crêpe, lost no time
in getting into it, and appeared promptly to exhibit herself
to her hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a lovely dress!” she exclaimed. “You look
perfectly dear in it. Did you get it in Marshville?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes, I did and I didn’t. Do you know a
Mary West, from Baltimore, Mrs. Austin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never heard of the lady. Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, and thought perhaps you could tell
me.” Then she related the tale of the mysterious
box, giving Miss Rindy’s theory regarding the
sender.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Austin was interested at once. “Whoever she
is, she has mighty good taste,” she declared. “I noticed
what a swagger coat and hat you had as soon as
I set my eyes on you, and that pretty wool dress you
have been wearing is quite out of the common,—nothing
you could pick up on a bargain counter.
Come along, honey child, I am very proud of you.
Phil is pacing the studio like a caged lion, so we’d
better not tarry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They took their meal at a French pastry shop near
by, and then went on to Mr. Barstow’s studio which
was not far away. They found their host dancing
around in great excitement. He was a little wiry man
with a bald head, dark eyes, large nose, and humorous
mouth. He grabbed Ellen’s hands and danced her
across the floor to where a table was littered with
paper and string.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, help me tie up my presents,” he cried. “I
haven’t them near ready. You come, too, Connie.
Phil can amuse himself by tying them on the tree as
we get them done. He is so tall we won’t need a stepladder.
Reed Marshall and I trimmed the tree last
night. Know Reed? Nice boy. He went out a while
ago, but he’ll be back; said he had to go, though I did
expect he would help me with these things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They all fell to work, and by the time the first guest
arrived the last package was tied on the tree. Then
the company trooped in, singly, in couples, and in
groups till the big studio was gay with bright costumes
and lively with chatter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fun began when Mr. Barstow mounted the
model stand and started to dance an Irish jig, which
he did with great agility. Then Mr. Austin’s tall
form made its way through the crowd, and, standing
by the dancer, this man with the dreamy eyes and
solemn face sang an absurd Irish song which nobody
could possibly have suspected him of being able to do.
The performance brought forth shouts of laughter and
wild applause.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely had these two performers stepped down
than some one dashed into the room, turned a handspring
upon the model stand, then stood grinning at the
company and rolling his eyes comically. He was blackened
up and wore the exaggerated dress of a negro
minstrel. Presently he burst out into a weird melody
with fanciful words and peculiar rhythm; this he followed
with a double shuffle. It was all so cleverly done
that some could scarce believe it was not a veritable
negro before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you get him? Is he a real darkey?”
some one asked Mr. Barstow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get him? I didn’t get him; he came. It is that
rascal, Reed Marshall. He insisted that he must go
when I wanted him to stay. Now I see what he was
up to. He said he’d come back and help; he’s doing
it. Go to it, boy,” he called out. “Give us a buck
and wing. Keep it up.” The order was obeyed, the
youth showing such a knowledge of his steps that the
applause was loud and long. As soon as it was over
the young man made his way to where Mr. Barstow
stood with Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Uncle Pete,” he said, “I told you I’d be
back to help, and here I am. Did I put it over all
right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You sure did, son,” returned Mr. Barstow,
smiling. “Come here, Reed; I want to present you
to Miss Ellen North. She is the daughter of one
of my old cronies, just as you are the son of another.
Now make yourself agreeable to Ellen while
I go hunt up Steve Kendall; he is going to play Santa
Claus. You may not recognize Reed when you meet
him again, Ellen, but that’s no matter. His get-up
doesn’t affect his character at all, nor go so far as to
color his speech.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went off, and the young man sat down by Ellen
on the divan. He looked at her with a smile that resembled
a grin because of the dark surroundings of
his white teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We should be friends because we are both children
of cronies; you are a cronette and I am a cronine. I
shall call you Cronette, henceforth. Isn’t Uncle Pete
the jolly little playmate? Have you known him
long?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, always. He and my father were students
together in Spain, and Daddy always called him Don
Pedro, which is what I call him. Where did you learn
to do those dances?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Down on de Easte’n Sho. Das whar I comes
from, chile. Is you a dancer, Sis’ Cronette?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “I used to be, but since I have been
living in Marshville I haven’t had much chance to do
anything so frivolous. My cousin with whom I live
believes in making me practical. The utilitarian alone
appeals to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So Useful is your front name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly: Useful Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like Cronette better. Say, I’d like mighty well
to paint you. Can you give me a chance? Your coloring
goes to my head. Will you sit for me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I can’t during these holidays. You see
I am visiting Mrs. Austin, and she has planned out all
sorts of things for me to do while I am here. You’d
better ask her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I do, Sis’ Cronette, an’ efen it please her sagacity,
I sho mek a little one o’ dese yer studies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are an artist, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trying to be. I goes to de League, an’ some o’
dese days I’se gwine to Eu’ope. Yuh been to Eu’ope,
Sis’ Cronette?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came near it, but I never got there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huccome?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother and I were going over to join my
father, but he came home to—to die. He was
wounded and gassed, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The grin faded from Reed’s face. “I didn’t know,
but I do know that he was a mighty good artist. I’ve
always liked his work tremendously.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am so glad. You have seen it here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you know Uncle Pete has a lot of his pictures
packed away. He means to have an exhibition
of them some day with some of his own work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My mother always hoped that could be done sometime.
Dear Don Pedro, it is like him to want to do
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here comes Santa Claus. We’d better go over
and see what he has for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Ellen, escorted by the grotesque figure, crossed
the room to where the tree, now lighted up by many
colored electric bulbs, was fast becoming surrounded
by the company.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a gift, and sometimes more than one, for
each person. “I can scarcely wait to see your present
to me,” Ellen whispered to Mrs. Austin. She did not
have to wait long, for in a few minutes Santa Claus
handed her a small box which she opened immediately,
to see smiling up at her the pictured face of her own
mother, painted upon ivory. It was as much as the
girl could do to choke back the tears, but she did, and
had barely whispered her thanks when her name was
again called, and another box was passed over to her.
This contained a string of crystal beads, Mr. Austin’s
gift, which she at once decided to wear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I see the miniature?” asked Reed at her
elbow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Austin painted it; you know that miniatures
are her specialty, and there is nothing in the world I
would rather have,” Ellen told him. “It is such a
good likeness of my dear mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man looked at it earnestly. “I don’t
wonder you treasure it,” he said, “and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But here he was interrupted by Mr. Barstow, who
came up with a large package which he laid in Ellen’s
arms, saying: “I wanted to give you this myself. It
was your father’s, and I want you to have it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen eagerly undid the string and took off the
wrappings. “Oh, Don Pedro, Don Pedro!” she
breathed. “Daddy’s violin, and you are giving it to
me? But I shouldn’t take it; it is too valuable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not too valuable for dear old Gerry’s daughter.
No, child, I want you to take it. All the better that
it is valuable, for if you get into a hole some day you
can sell it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me know when you reach the hole,” spoke
up Reed. “I always have been crazy about that violin,
haven’t I, Uncle Pete? It has a most wonderful tone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you have played on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Often.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then play a farewell.” She gave the violin into
his hands and he drew the bow across the strings,
tuned up, and played the simple air of “Holy Night.”
Then he handed back the instrument “Now you,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know only one thing very well,” she announced,
and began the melody she had played at the birthday
party. “Dear old Jeremy Todd taught me that,” she
said as she ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jeremy Todd? You don’t mean to say you know
old Jeremy?” exclaimed Mr. Barstow. “Where did
you run across him? I’ve not seen him or heard of
him for years. Used to know him well. What’s become
of him, and why doesn’t he show up? Lots of
talent. We all believed he would make his mark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen gave such information as she could, Mr. Barstow
listening attentively, and at the close shaking his
head and saying, “Poor old chap! Poor old Jeremy!
I’d like mighty well to see him again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But here entered Kogi with a great tray, and Mr.
Barstow skipped off to see that the refreshments were
served properly. Delicious they were and of great
variety, so abundant, too, that it is a wonder that
any one was able to join in the carols with which the
evening ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen went off hugging her violin, for the gift of
which she had hugged and kissed the giver. “Dear
Don Pedro,” she whispered, “I can never thank you
enough for this. It has been such a wonderful evening
altogether. I shall remember it to my dying day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed Marshall followed her to the street. “If it
wasn’t for this rig I sure would see you home, Cronette,
but I’m coming to see you. Mrs. Austin says I
may, but she won’t make any promises about the
sittings, for she says she is chock-full of engagements
for you, and I shall just have to take my chances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d really like to see what you look like in your
true character,” said Ellen laughing. “I feel sort of
queer about you, as if you were not a real somebody.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll convince you that I am, at the very first opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mr. and Mrs. Austin were waiting, so Ellen ran
on to join them, and they walked briskly home with
the music of the Christmas carols still ringing in their
ears.</p>

    <div>BRIGHT DAYS AND DARK ONES</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Although Reed Marshall kept his promise of
coming to see Ellen, not once was she at home
when he called, which he did several times. All
through that holiday week there was something going
on, for it seemed that the old friends outdid themselves
in their efforts to give Ellen pleasure. There
were teas, luncheons and theatre parties, musicales, concerts,
and, if nothing else offered, there were trips to
the picture galleries, so that the girl’s time was entirely
taken up, and when the hour of her departure struck
she knew no more what Reed looked like than if she
had never seen him. Indeed it is not surprising that
he passed out of her memory almost entirely when two
surprising incidents took place almost at the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was at one of the studios on the day before New
Year’s that Ellen noticed a pretty girl looking at her
with evident interest. Music was going on; some one
was singing. Ellen waited till the song was over before
she whispered to Mrs. Austin: “Do you know
who that girl is, the one in purple, sitting by Mrs.
Everleigh? She has been staring at me as if I were
a curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never saw her before that I know of. We’ll find
out directly, when the music is over and we have tea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That moment arrived before long. Mrs. Austin
arose. “You stay here and I’ll go find out about the
purple girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She had no sooner gone than the purple girl herself
came and took the chair Mrs. Austin had vacated.
“Would you mind telling me your name?” she said.
“I came in late, and in such a crowd of course one
doesn’t wait for introductions. I am Mabel Wickham,
Mrs. Everleigh’s niece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am Ellen North,” was the prompt reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not Ellen North from Marshville?” Miss Wickham
leaned closer while an amused look crept into her
eyes as they travelled from Ellen’s hat to her dress
and then to the coat which hung over the back of a
chair in front of the two. “Is that your coat?” came
the abrupt question. “Oh, I beg your pardon for
being so rude. I have no right to ask such questions.
Did you say you lived in Marshville?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen hadn’t said so, but she answered: “Yes, I live
there. Is that where you have seen me? Do you
know the place?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never was there in my life, but——” She was
no longer able to keep back her laughter, though presently
she bit her lip and tried to look politely serious.
“You really must excuse me. I must seem a perfect
idiot, but I keep thinking of something so funny that
it makes me laugh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment she spied a handkerchief lying on
the floor, which she picked up and began to examine.
Ellen meantime searched for the one she now missed.
“I think that must be mine,” she said; “it fell out
of my lap, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid you are mistaken,” rejoined Miss
Wickham. “See, it bears my initials, and, besides,
has my private mark, a black dot in the corner, a
very tiny one, to be sure, but there it is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Ellen’s turn to stare; then suddenly came
illumination. “You are Mary West!” she cried. “I
know you are, and that is why you have been looking
at me so hard; it is because of the hat and dress. You
recognize them, but why is your name Mabel Wickham,
and how did you know about me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Wickham was silent for a moment. “You
won’t be mad if I tell you? I’ll ’fess up, though I
know you will be absolutely convinced that I am the
idiot I seem to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mad? I’m only delighted that I have a chance to
thank the good fairy who sent me that box and made
it possible for me not to mortify my friends here
when I came to visit them. Do please tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it was done in the manner of a joke, I was
going out of mourning, and had already given away
a lot of things to perfectly ungrateful, unappreciative
persons, so I thought I’d do something unusual. I
packed a few things in a box to go off just anywhere,
I didn’t care where. Then I thought up a nice ordinary
name. Ellen seemed to please me, but Ellen—what?
I stood up, shut my eyes, and turned around
two or three times. When I opened them I was facing
north. Ellen North, said I, a good sensible name,
so I wrote that on the box. Then it occurred to me
that the name of the sender would be required. I took
my own initials; Mary would do for Mabel, and, as
points of the compass were in order, West would do
for Wickham. The next question was where to send
it. I opened a map, shut my eyes again, and plumped
my finger down anywhere. It happened to fall on
Marshville, so there you are. I know you must think
me the silliest, most fanciful person in the world, but
I enjoyed the game and sent out my box into the unknown,
wondering what would happen to it, and if
any one would get it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is like a real Christmas fairy tale,” declared
Ellen, “and a lovely one for me. I don’t see how
you thought of doing that way; yes, I do, though, for
I just love to use my imagination, and I am pleased
to pieces to think the things came my way just as if
a fairy godmother had brought them in a pumpkin-shell
chariot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you dear thing! I just love your saying that.
I believe we are going to be friends. I don’t have
many friends because so many people are stupid; at
least, they think my flights of fancy are just crazy
foolishness. Perhaps I am as stupid as they because
it isn’t yet through my noddle how you happened to
guess I was Mary West.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because of the handkerchief, you see. It was
such a nice fine one. I found it in the pocket of the
coat and so I used it. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Wickham opened her bag and produced a
handkerchief exactly like the one she had picked up
from the floor. “Twins!” she exclaimed. “But, oh,
dear, you are minus a handkerchief if I keep this one;
that will not do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please don’t bother. I had several for Christmas,
beauties, from Mr. Barstow’s Christmas tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will need this before you can get at the
others. You can borrow it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll be glad to, and I’ll send it to you properly
laundered. Shall you be here long, or are you going
back to Baltimore?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know that Baltimore is my home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was on the box; ‘Mary West, Baltimore.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course; I had forgotten. I shall be at Mrs.
Everleigh’s for another week, and I do hope we shall
meet again before you leave. May I come to Mrs.
Austin’s to see you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed you may, though I am to be here but a
couple of days longer; then, ‘back to the mines.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O dear! I do want to know you better and to
hear all about you——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But here Mrs. Everleigh came up. “Time to go,
Mabel,” she said. “Didn’t you girls want any tea?
I saw you two talking away for dear life, as if you
were old and tried friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we are in a measure,” replied Mabel. “Ellen
knows some intimate acquaintances of mine.” The
two girls exchanged glances and laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the joke?” inquired Mrs. Everleigh
curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just a little private one. You’ll take me to the
Austins’ studio, won’t you, Auntie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if you’ll come along now. We must be getting
home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They made their farewells to Ellen and moved away,
Mabel losing no time in making inquiries about this
new acquaintance, but saying no word about the box.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen, too, was prompt in hunting up Mrs. Austin
and learning what she might about Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I found out about your purple girl,” said Mrs.
Austin, “though, from the way you two jabbered away
like magpies, I don’t suppose there is much you haven’t
learned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t learn so very much,” declared Ellen, “but
we found out that we have many things in common.
Tell me about her, please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is a very wealthy girl, lives in Baltimore with
her grandmother. Her mother died when she was but
a small child, and her father a few years ago. Mrs.
Everleigh is her aunt. I believe the girl is considered
rather peculiar, doesn’t care for society, a grave fault
in the grandmother’s eyes, who, like many Baltimoreans,
prefers the social whirl and the good things of
life rather than the intellectual ones. Mrs. Everleigh
says her niece lives in a world of her own to which
but few are admitted. You liked her, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very much, and she wants to come to see me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>However, the girls were not destined to meet again
at this time, for upon Ellen’s arrival at the studio
there was a telegram for her which meant an early
start for home the next morning. The telegram read:
“Have had an accident. Come at once. Orinda
Crump.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an unhappy beginning of the new year. The
lonely, wearisome railway journey full of apprehension,
the regrets for the good times that the day was
to have afforded, the fears for what might be looked
for in the future, all these brought a nervous, overwrought
girl to Marshville.</p>

<p class='c009'>As she stepped from the train she looked around
for some one to give her news of Miss Rindy, and, to
her relief, saw Dr. Rowe, who came up at once.
“Well, Ellen,” was his greeting, “I was watching for
you. Come right with me; my car is waiting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cousin Rindy, tell me, Doctor, what has happened
to her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing that she won’t recover from, although it
makes it pretty bad for the present She fell and
broke her hip yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is at home of course. Who is with her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seemed best that she should go to the hospital,
in fact she insisted upon it,—said she couldn’t afford
trained nurses and all that. I took her myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But hospitals cost a lot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes they do and sometimes they don’t.”
The doctor was non-committal. “I am going to take
you there now. Rindy wants to see you, I know. I
sent the telegram in her name, though she didn’t want
to have it sent at all; said she didn’t want to break
up your visit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s just like her; she never thinks of herself.
Will she have to stay at the hospital for a long time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That depends. I told her not to be troubled about
you, for you can stay with us. Caro is entranced at
the thought. I shall be going over to the hospital every
day and can take you along, for she will want to see
you that often.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I shall want to see her. How good you are,
Doctor. Does she suffer much?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She did at first, and will when she begins to exercise
again, but she is fairly comfortable now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a ride of but a few miles to the hospital,
and soon Ellen was following the doctor through a
long corridor to the room where Miss Rindy was. A
white-gowned nurse met them at the door. “How
is the patient?” inquired the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doing very well,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor beckoned to Ellen, who was soon looking
down upon the pale face of her cousin. “Well,
Ellen,” was the greeting, “this is a pretty how-do-you-do,
isn’t it? I could kick myself for a clumsy old
fool. No, I couldn’t either, not with one leg out of
commission. I want you to get some of my things
that I shall need, for goodness knows how long I may
have to stick here. Go over there, Sam Rowe, and
talk to the nurse; I have things to say to Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor nodded understandingly to the nurse and
the two went toward the door while Ellen drew up a
chair close to the bed. “Now, listen,” began Miss
Rindy. “I’m not going to stay in this expensive
room. It is all nonsense. I am no better than lots of
others in the free ward, and not half so good as some.
Look at the way our boys had to endure privations and
discomforts in hurry-up hospitals over there. I reckon
I can stand what they did. Sam Rowe won’t listen
to me, but I want you to impress upon him that I
cannot pay for this room and a private nurse. He
has got to understand it. You tell him so. Now,
take that bit of paper and write down the list of things
I want.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen did as she was bid, glad that she had made no
promise of persuading the doctor to move her cousin.
She had no more than finished her list than the doctor
came over to the bed. “I think we’ve stayed long
enough for this time, Ellen,” he said. “I’ll bring her
again to-morrow, Rindy. She is going to stay with
us, so you needn’t worry a bit about her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe you think I have nothing else to worry
about, Sam Rowe. You’ll be wishing me a happy
New Year next, I suppose. A nice year I have ahead
of me, haven’t I? The best I can expect is that I
shall be able to go around on crutches, but I am not
going to end my days hobbling. When I get into my
death bed I mean to walk there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good sport!” cried the doctor. “That’s the way
to talk. You may have to begin with crutches, but I
venture to say you won’t end with them. See you to-morrow,
Rindy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ellen hasn’t told me a word about her visit,” complained
Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Time enough for that,” called back the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you forget what I told you, Ellen,” Miss
Rindy charged as her visitors went out the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen was almost in tears as they drove away. “It
is so pitiful to see her laid up like that,” she said.
“She has always been so active and capable. Will
she ever walk again, Doctor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure she will, though not for some time, but
she has the perseverance and courage of a dozen
women to see her through. She may not be quite so
active, but she is young enough to get back a lot of
her powers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She vows she is not going to stay in that room,
that she must go into the free ward,” said Ellen after
a silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all nonsense! The idea of Rindy Crump
going into the free ward. She must stay right where
she is. To-morrow I shall tell her that she can’t be
moved because it will only retard her recovery, that
there is no room in the free ward, anything at all to
keep her satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she’ll not be satisfied. She has a horror of
debt, and will worry over the expense.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She mustn’t worry. What about those rich relatives
of hers? Can’t they come to the fore?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’d rather die than appeal to them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What about her brother? It surely is time he
was doing something for her, after all she has done
for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She never hears from him. I believe he is in
Seattle and doing well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph! Somebody ought to let him know the
state of affairs and at least give him a chance to wipe
out some of his obligations. I notice that most persons
are mighty eager to accept help, but are ready to give
aid to anybody except those who came to their assistance.
It is a queer twist in human nature.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen thought over this statement and immediately
took it to heart, determining that she would never be
one of that class. She spoke her thought openly. “I
hope the day will come when I can show Cousin Rindy
how much I appreciate all she has done for me. I
wish I could do it now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you worry about the present. We’ll fix it
up somehow. Rindy has too many good friends in
this town to let her suffer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O dear! But she couldn’t stand being an object
of charity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She needn’t be. I suppose it would be allowable
to lend her what is required, and let her pay in her
own good time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen was silent, although she knew that nothing
would fret her cousin more than the knowledge of a
debt hanging over her. They had arrived at the doctor’s
by now, and Caro was on the watch for her beloved
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so thrilled,” she exclaimed, “to think I am
to have you right here under the same roof with me.
Of course I’m awfully sorry for poor Miss Rindy,
but at the same time I can’t but be happy that anything
has happened to bring you back sooner, and,
better still, to bring you to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen could not meet this exuberance with like enthusiasm,
but she responded as well as she could, and
went in to the excellent dinner, Caro’s arm embracing
her waist, and Mrs. Rowe ready with a hearty welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were a good many New Year’s callers that
afternoon and evening, for Marshville was still old-fashioned
enough to keep up this custom, and Ellen
found herself called upon to be chief entertainer, as
every one demanded a full account of her visit to the
city. She must exhibit the miniature of her mother,
the crystal beads, and the rest of her gifts to the satisfaction
and admiration of her girl friends, so really
she quite enjoyed herself, and was not so cast down
as she had expected to be.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What clever, clever friends you have,” sighed
Sally Cooper, “painters and musicians and all that.
Do any of them compose, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen looked puzzled. “Do you mean write
music?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I meant do they compose stories, novels, and
things?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen bit her lip and glanced across the room at
Clyde Fawcett, who grinned an appreciation of Sally’s
would-be elegance. “I believe some of those I met
do write. I know one or two are journalists and
others are contributors to the magazines,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How wonderful!” sighed Sally. “I expect we
seem very commonplace to you. That Christmas Eve
party must have been such fun, and wasn’t it romantic
to talk all evening to the boy who blacked up, and never
find out what he looked like?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll bet he looked like an ape,” broke in Frank
Ives gruffly. Frank, by the way, had brought Ellen
an ornate box of candy, large in size and delectable as
to contents. She was glad to pass it around, and one
may be sure that there was not much left by the time
the evening was over.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must be worn to a frazzle, you poor darling,”
said Caro as the door closed after the last guest.
“You haven’t had a moment for rest. Now please
sleep as late as you feel like in the morning and I’ll
bring up your breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are a dear, thoughtful thing, Caro,” said
Ellen, bestowing a kiss upon her friend’s glowing
cheek. “I don’t expect to sleep late, for I promised
Cousin Rindy that I would go over to the house and
get some things to take out to her, and your father
says we shall go as soon as his office hours are over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Need you go? Dad could take them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I must go. I want to see Cousin Rindy,
and she would be so disappointed if I failed to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am not going to keep you up. I want
you to go right to sleep.” This remark showed great
consideration on Caro’s part, for she had been counting
on one of those confidential talks which girls so
love to indulge in at bedtime, but her love rose above
her desire, and she left her friend without the prolonged
good-night that would have pleased her.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ellen did not go right to sleep. In this first
quiet moment her thoughts rioted. There was so much
to consider, to plan, to execute. Uppermost was the
consideration of Miss Rindy’s position. It was all so
difficult. For all the doctor had told her not to worry,
she knew that she must, for no one could realize so
well what debt meant to Miss Rindy. “Of course we
can scrimp and save,—we shall have to,—but it will
be a long, uphill pull. If only I could think of some
way to earn enough.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She lay with wide-open eyes, staring into the dark;
then all at once she sat up, as a brilliant idea came to
her. “Of course,” she exclaimed, “that would fix it.
Why didn’t I think of it before?” Then she lay
down, turned over, and in a few minutes was fast
asleep.</p>

    <div>THE VIOLIN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There was no lying abed for Ellen the next
morning. There were things to be done, and
to be done quickly, so she lost no time in getting ready
immediately after breakfast to go to her cousin’s
house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why you are in such a hurry,” complained
Caro. “If you will wait a while, I can go
with you. Mother wants to try on the dress I am to
wear to Florence’s party this evening. Of course you
will go, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I am not invited.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is because Florence didn’t know you would
be here. When she knows you are visiting me of
course she will expect you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen shook her head. “I don’t think so. Moreover,
I really don’t feel in the humor for going; I am
tired after all the excitement of the past week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, maybe you’ll change your mind before night.
I do want you to go with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen did not reply, but hurried off. It was a crisp,
bright morning. Snow, which had fallen a few days
before, still lay in little heaps on the spots untouched
by the sun. As Ellen turned the key in the door
Wipers bounded to meet her from a warm corner
where he had been curled up. She stooped to stroke
him, and then entered the chilly house. It was very
still and desolate, windows barred and lower rooms
dark. Ellen did not tarry on the lower floor, but
mounted the stairs to her own room, leaving her violin
on the hall table.</p>

<p class='c009'>How cold and silent it was, yet the sun was streaming
in, and, as she looked around at the familiar
objects, she realized that this was home and that she
was glad to get back to it. She busied herself for a
time in putting together the things Miss Rindy had
asked for, and when these were ready she went back
to her own room, took out her writing materials, and
sat thoughtfully looking out the window. She had
kept on her coat, so she decided that she would not
take cold if she remained long enough to write the
note, which was an important one. How should she
begin it? Should she say “My dear Reed,” “Dear
Cronine,” or “My dear Mr. Marshall”? Finally she
decided that as this was a strictly business matter she
would best be as formal as possible; therefore she
wrote:</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dear Mr. Marshall:</span></p>

<p class='c011'>“If you were in earnest about wanting my
father’s violin if I ever wished to part with it, I am
ready to offer it to you. The hole is quite a deep one,
otherwise I could not think of giving up dear Mr.
Barstow’s Christmas gift; you remember that he said
I could sell it if ever I was in a hole, so I must do
it now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She read over carefully what she had written, and
then added:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Please don’t think you must take the violin if you
don’t want it. Perhaps you spoke on the spur of the
moment, and didn’t really mean me to take you seriously.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She hesitated a moment before signing her name.
Then she slipped the note into the envelope, and began
the address: “Mr. Reed Marshall.” Suddenly she
realized that she did not know where the young man
lived. “I shall have to send it in Mr. Barstow’s care,”
she soliloquized, “and I ought to write to him and
explain. It wouldn’t do to sell his gift without telling
him why I am doing it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She wrote another note, enclosed the one to Reed,
and felt that the matter was concluded. “It can go
off in the evening mail, and he should get it to-morrow,”
she told herself. “I should have an answer in
a few days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time her fingers were stiff with cold, and, as
there was no reason why she should linger, she hurried
off, bearing the bag containing her cousin’s belongings
and her violin. The latter she wanted to show to
Jeremy Todd, but just as she was about to turn in at
his gate she saw him ahead of her, and hastened to
catch up with him. This, however, she did not do
till he had reached the church, where he turned in.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen was right at his heels as he fitted the big key in
the door. “Happy New Year, Mr. Jeremy Todd!”
she greeted him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He flung open the door, and held out both hands.
“Well, this is a surprise,” he cried. “When did you
get in? Have you seen Rindy? How is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I got in yesterday and went right out to the hospital.
Cousin Rindy is doing as well as one could
expect, but of course she worries. May I come in
with you? I have such a lot to tell you, and I want
to consult you about something. You know I am
nothing if not a consulter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come right in and tell me all about it. We certainly
have missed you, child. It made me feel very
lonesome to see the house next door shut up and
deserted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They entered the church and seated themselves near
the organ. Then Ellen poured forth her tale, concluding
with: “So, you see, Mr. Todd, here is my chance
to do something for Cousin Rindy, something really
worth while. Of course I am sorry to give up dear
Daddy’s violin, but I am not used yet to owning it, so
it is better to give it up before it becomes harder to
do. It will be a comfort to think that it is in the hands
of one who will treasure it, that is, if he really does
want it. Besides, I am not expecting to be a violinist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And this young man is?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, he must be of a sort, although he is studying
to be an artist he told me. Funny I never thought
to ask him to try the violin again. I saw him only
once, you know. I want you to try it and tell me
what you think of it.” She took it from its case and
handed it over to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He handled it reverently, tuned it, and played a few
measures. “It is a very fine instrument,” he assured
her, “and should be worth a big price.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As much as a hundred dollars?” asked Ellen eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is worth more, though perhaps you may not
get anything beyond that. I wish it were my privilege
to afford to buy it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will keep it for me, won’t you, till Reed
wants it? I would be so glad if you would take charge
of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not keep it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen shook her head. “No, the longer I have it
the harder it will be to part with it. I know it will
be safe in your hands, and perhaps you will like to
play on it sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That I surely will. This Mr. Barstow of whom
you speak, is his name Peter, by any chance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is indeed, and he knows you. He was so glad
when I could tell him about you; said he was going
to write to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My old friend, Don Pedro; well, well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do you call him that? So did Daddy, and I
do when I am with him. Reed calls him Uncle Pete.
Isn’t it funny that Reed’s father and mine both were
what Mr. Barstow calls old cronies, and Reed says I
am a cronette and he is a cronine in consequence. He
is a very ridiculous person.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd looked at her thoughtfully. “And you
like him very much, this lad?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I liked him with a black face; I don’t know how
much I should like him with a white one. Probably
he will seem quite a different person. I must run along
now, or Caro will think I am lost. I shall see you soon
again, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We begin our organ lessons again on Saturday,
don’t we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s up to you, Mr. Music Master.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then by all means. I shall want your report of
the sale of your violin as soon as you have it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That you shall.” She left him softly playing upon
the violin, and went on to mail her note. “It’s just as
well that it is addressed to Don Pedro,” she said to
herself, “otherwise Mrs. Perry would be consumed
with curiosity to know who my new correspondent
might be. She keeps a mental list of all my other
ones, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caro was just stepping out of the completed party
frock when Ellen came into the room where she was.
“What a time you have been,” she exclaimed. “You
haven’t been shut up in that cold house all this time,
I hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no; I was at the church with Mr. Todd part
of the time, and I went to the post-office to mail a
letter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Frank Ives has been trying to get you on the
’phone. He has called up two or three times.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He wouldn’t leave his message, although I tried
to get him to. He said he must speak to you himself,
and that he would come around before one o’clock, so
don’t run off again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen’s only response was: “How pretty your dress
is, Caro. It is mighty becoming, too. You’ll be the
belle of the ball.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not if you are there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which I shall not be, and it is nonsense to say I
would be a belle if I were there. Florence would see
to it that I played the part of wall flower.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to see her try, then; not with Frank and
Clyde and the other boys there. You are not going
to be so cruel as to refuse to go, Ellen, when you
know how disappointed I shall be, not to mention several
others. You can wear your lovely crêpe de Chine
that you look so perfectly dear in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just here a big red car dashed up to the door and
Frank Ives sprang out. “I can’t go down,” declared
Caro. “He wants to see you anyway, and I am not
dressed. Go along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was nothing left to do but go, which Ellen
did half reluctantly. For some reason she didn’t care
to see Frank just then. It was evident, however, that
he very much wanted to see her. “I came to apologize,”
were his first words. “Flo didn’t know you
were here till I told her, so that explains why you
haven’t received an invitation to her party. If you
don’t mind the informality of it, I am the bearer of a
verbal invitation which we hope you will accept. I
want to come for you, and please give me as many
dances as you can. Please don’t say No. You will
spoil my evening if you do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With two persons asserting that the evening would
be spoiled for them if she refused to attend the party,
Ellen was obliged to give in, and sent Frank off in
high feather. If she had but known, the invitation
was entirely due to the stand he took in the matter,
for he announced that he would not appear unless
Ellen were there. “I’ll go and spend the evening
with her,” he declared to his sister, “so count me out,
Miss Snobby.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you are perfectly horrid,” pouted Florence.
“It’s my party, and I reckon I can invite who
I choose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you can,” retorted Frank, “but allee samee
you can count me out, and I’d advise you to give an
hour’s study to your grammar before you mingle in
society.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Florence
returned. “I reckon I can talk as good grammar
as you or any of the boys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank shrugged his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows
as he turned to walk away. He had not reached
the door before Florence called him back. “I never
can have my own way,” she fumed. “What is it
you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you to give me leave to invite Ellen in
your name. I can make it all right with her, I think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What will you do for me if I consent?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll dance with that little foolish Suzanne Mills,
or any one else you may select.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, but Ellen is such a Priss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is not at all. You don’t know her; she can
be as jolly as the next, and stars! how she can sing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very well, go along and get your little red-headed
missy, only don’t expect me to fall on her
neck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have to be decently polite; that’s all I ask.
I’ll see that she has a good time, so I should worry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So that is how Ellen happened to go to the dance,
and, to the chagrin of her hostess, she had all the
attention she could desire, and did not in the least miss
the blandishments which Florence bestowed upon some
of her guests, notably Suzanne Mills, who was a
flapper of flappers, and as brainless a little somebody
as one could meet, but she glittered in shining raiment,
and was bestrung with gauds, so she could not help
attracting attention. “Her people are awful rich,—that’s
a real pearl necklace she’s got on,” Ellen heard
Florence remark; and, thinking of Mabel Wickham,
who also was “awful rich” but who dressed simply
and made no display of jewelry, Ellen smiled. However,
the blood rushed to her face when Suzanne
asked, “Who is the red-headed girl that your brother
Frank is so devoted to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s a sort of a little ‘orphant Annie,’ taken
up by one of her relatives who lives here. She is poor
as poverty, and I’d never have invited her if Frank
hadn’t insisted upon it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She doesn’t look poor,” returned Suzanne.
“That’s a handsome dress she has on, and those look
like real rock-crystal beads she wears.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably some rich friend gave them to her; her
cousin couldn’t afford either dress or beads, unless
Ellen badgered her till she was obliged to give them
to her to keep peace. It’s pretty hard on Miss Rindy
to have to support a girl who is old enough to make
her own living.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen’s face was flaming as the girls moved off. If
only she could have escaped from her corner before
those two came near enough for her to hear what they
said. Eavesdropping? Perhaps it was, but she was
hemmed in by a screen of palms, and could not easily
have made her way out without crowding others. She
was waiting for Frank, who had established her
there.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently he came up, bearing a plate of chicken
salad in one hand and one of oysters in the other.
“I’ll get you some ice-cream and cake in a minute,”
he said. “This is a nice, quiet corner, isn’t it? Just
big enough for two. Rather a tight squeeze getting
in and out, but room enough when you get here. I’ve
had my eye on it from the first. I’ll be right back.”
He set down the plates, and Ellen saw him threading
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p class='c009'>She felt that the food would choke her if she attempted
to eat it, but how dispose of it? She could
not let Frank see that it had not been touched. She
looked around wildly. It would never do to empty it
in any of the pots or tubs which held the palms. Then
she realized that this was a bay window. Perhaps
she could lift one of the sashes. She made the attempt,
and found she could open the window far enough to
allow her to toss out the contents of the plates, trusting
that a dog or cat would discover it before morning.
Then she sat back, fervently hoping that Frank
would not return before what would seem a reasonable
time for one to eat what he had brought. “He
certainly will think I have a good appetite,” she said
to herself as she regarded the empty dishes which she
set down under one of the palms.</p>

<p class='c009'>As luck would have it Frank did not return very
soon. “There was such a mob I could scarcely get
near the tables,” he said, “but I knew how to turn
the trick by going around the back way, and I snatched
a bite for myself while the going was good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen picked at the ice-cream and nibbled a macaroon,
but permitted herself to appear more absorbed
in Frank’s long-winded account of how he was nearly
held up for speeding a few days before. Frank was
never eloquent, and his tales always held many digressions.
Ellen made few comments, for her thoughts
were not on the subject. She longed for the time to
come when she might go, or, at least, that there might
be an interruption.</p>

<p class='c009'>This came before long, when Clyde Fawcett’s face
appeared between branches of a tall palm. “So this
is where you are twosing,” he exclaimed. “I might
have known foxy old Frank would seek some out-of-the-way
corner. They are going to start up the music
again, Ellen, and this is our dance. Tight squeeze
getting out, isn’t it? Here, I’ll help you. Step on the
edge of that tub.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With the help of her two cavaliers Ellen managed
an escape from her bower and was soon among the
dancers, desperately longing for the time to come when
she could make her farewells. At last the hour arrived
when Caro in her rosy dress came up to her.
“Dad is here for me,” she said. “Are you going
home with us, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much she isn’t,” Frank spoke up. “I brought
her and I shall take her home. Stay for another dance
or two, Hazel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, I mustn’t,” Ellen spoke hastily. “Mrs.
Rowe will be sitting up for us, and I must get back
when Caro does.” And in spite of Frank’s persuasions
she kept to her decision, glad when she could
follow in Caro’s wake and murmur a few polite words
to Florence as they took their leave. As she stepped
into the big red car she cast one backward look at the
pretentious, brilliantly lighted mansion. “Farewell,
Castle Mammon,” she said to herself. “I hope never
to enter your walls again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She said not a word to Caro of the conversation between
Florence and Suzanne, but she did pour out her
heart to her good old friend, Jeremy Todd. “They
are so different, so very different from the people my
mother and father knew. Nobody cared who was rich
or who was poor. If they were good and talented
and kind, it was all that mattered, and no one could
have better times than artists and their friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd nodded in assent. “I know that full
well. ‘The life is more than meat, and the body than
raiment.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never understood that so well before,” replied
Ellen reflectively. “It is like something my mother
used to tell me her old mammy often said of a certain
sordidly rich family: ‘Dey has money, but dey hasn’t
nothin’ else.’ How true that can be of some.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd laughed. “That’s worth remembering,
and one should be sorry for those who have nothing
but money. With only that one cannot buy an appreciation
of beauty, nor character, nor truth; in fact,
few of the really worth-while things can be bought
with money, and they are the rich who can enjoy the
heaven-sent gifts instead of grubbing for what earth
can supply.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is mighty nice to have riches,” sighed Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To do good with, to help others, yes, and they
are blest who have both the heavenly spirit and the
earthly means.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the earthly means I am yearning for just
now. One reason I am so angry with Florence is
that she hit upon the truth when she said I should be
earning my living. Plenty of girls of sixteen do earn
it, and I must be casting around to find a way to do
the same. It is intolerable to be spoken of as a charity
girl who is sponging on a relative.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd looked distressed. “I think, my dear,
that your work is cut out for you while Rindy is laid
up. When she is well it will be time enough for you
to think of your independence. By the way, have
you heard from your young friend about the violin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, and it’s getting to be time that I did.
Of course I can’t expect he will be as prompt as I
want him to be, but I am getting a trifle impatient.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still it was several days before the letter did come,
and in the meantime Caro asked Ellen what she had
done with the violin. “I am letting Mr. Todd keep
it,” she explained. “It is of more use to him than
to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but I love to hear you play that pretty piece on
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d soon get tired of that; I’d be like a music
box that plays only one tune. No, it’s better Mr.
Jeremy should keep it for the present.” In this way
she put off Caro, and felt that she had done it rather
cleverly.</p>

<p class='c009'>To her great joy Reed’s letter came one day when
she went herself to the post-office. She could hardly
wait to open it, and hurried back, not to the doctor’s,
but to her old home, where, “If I have to cry nobody
will see me,” she said to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to her own little room she went, sat down, and
held the letter a moment or two before opening it,
but, when she finally did, out fell a check which she
hurriedly scanned. Down went the letter on the floor.
“Oh! Oh! Oh!” she exclaimed. “It is too good
to be true. It may be only filthy lucre, but, oh, how
glad I am to get it! Say what you will, Mr. Todd,
there are moments in life when there is nothing like a
check to satisfy one’s cravings.” She held out the
check before her and gazed at it fondly. “I could
kiss you, but I will only press you to my heart,” which
she proceeded to do. “Now, let’s see what that nice
boy has to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She picked up the letter, which read:</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Cronette:</span></p>

<p class='c011'>“You must think me a beast for not answering
your note sooner, but the fact of the matter is that I
am laid up with a mean attack of grippe, and, lest my
temperature should be too seriously affected by a note
from you, Uncle Pete didn’t hand it over till this
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course I want the dear fiddle, want it like the
mischief, but I feel like a thief to take it from you.
However, if it helps you out of a hole to cash the
within meagre check, I send it along; and if the time
comes when you want to buy it back, the fiddle, I
mean, you must feel free to do it. By that time it
may be a little shop-worn, so you should beat me down
in the price. Remember that I am not paying what it
is worth, but perhaps you will consider that my deep
appreciation is worth something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I could come for it myself, but, ‘Nay, nay,
Pauline,’ says the doctor. If you have a chance to
send it by some reliable messenger please do so, for
it is too precious to be sent by any ordinary means.
If no such trustworthy person appears on the horizon,
just wait till I can come for it or can send some one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was bad luck not to have a chance of seeing
you again, but I shall do it yet. Somehow I feel it in
my bones, honey chile, dat we is gwine be de bes’ ob
fren’s.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c013'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“What a nice, nice boy,” murmured Ellen as she
folded the letter and put it back in the envelope; but
almost immediately she took it out and read it all over
again. Then she sat in deep thought for a while, but
suddenly she jumped up, gathered together her letter
and check, and ran in next door to show them to Mr.
Todd.</p>

    <div>A DULL WINTER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In answer to Ellen’s ring Jeremy himself appeared
from the kitchen where he was wiping dishes. Ellen
fluttered her check before his eyes. “It’s come!
It’s come!” she cried. “A hundred and fifty dollars,
dear man. Isn’t it perfectly wonderful?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No more than it should be, not as much, in fact,
but I’m heartily glad. I had a notion you’d get a
letter to-day, for I’ve just received one from Peter
Barstow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And did he say anything about the violin? He
wouldn’t, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? That is just the very subject he did
write about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How exciting! Do tell me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But just here came a call from the kitchen:
“Jeremy, Jeremy, stop that gossiping and come back
and finish your work. Shut that door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, dear,” came the response. “Meet me at the
church in half an hour,” said the good old man hurriedly
to Ellen, who only too well understood the
situation. Mrs. Todd’s orders were not to be ignored,
and dear old Jeremy never attempted apologies.</p>

<p class='c009'>So he returned to his dishes, and Ellen went back
to her room to gloat over her check and to plan how
it was to be spent. The time thus employed passed
so quickly that Jeremy was already at the organ when
she reached the church. He nodded to her, but continued
to draw forth harmonious chords absorbedly.
She picked up her violin, which she discovered lying
on the bench, and held it lovingly till the last note
from the organ died away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jeremy turned toward her with a smile. She held
out the violin to him. “Please,” she said, and sat
with chin in hands while he tuned up and then played
a quaint old air. “One more,” said Ellen, “and then
we’ll talk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing loath Jeremy continued to play, ending
with a note so fine and high that it seemed as if it
must issue from a thread of gossamer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen drew a long sigh. “I wish I could play like
that,” she said, “but now I never shall. I suppose
I’m consumed with selfishness, but I do hate to give
up the darling violin. One part of me is thankful
and willing to do anything for Cousin Rindy, and the
other part rebels like fury.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly human and natural,” declared Mr. Todd.
“Your first impulse was strong enough not to make
you hesitate a minute to make the sacrifice, so I don’t
see that you need flagellate your soul so severely.
You will always have music, always have the great
gift of appreciation, and that means everything. No
matter what discords there are without, one can always
find harmony within.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen nodded. She knew where the outside discords
lay, so far as he was concerned, and she knew of the
sacrifices he made to keep peace. Others might laugh
at that oft-reiterated, “Yes, dear,” but it prevented
war, sweet bells jangled, and all that. “Now tell me
what Don Pedro said,” she began, settling herself
comfortably.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He says just what one who knew him might expect.
He wants me to come to see him, to bring the
violin, and makes the excuse of sending me a ticket
because I am employed as messenger, a pack-horse,
you’d suppose, from his elaborate apologies for burdening
me with so weighty an object as a violin, one so
valuable that I am liable to be set upon by thieves
and am running terrible risks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t that just like Don Pedro? He never does
a nice thing for you but he makes you think you are
doing him a tremendous favor. Shall you go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s as you say. Will you trust me with the
violin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You dear, silly man, of course I will. I am delighted
that you have the chance of seeing your old
friend, and there is no one I would rather entrust the
violin to; you know that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you take the organ next Sunday, and will
you forego your usual Saturday lesson?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course. I have had my holiday, now you must
take yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then say farewell to the violin, for I leave to-night.
Don Pedro wants me to come at once, for the
boy is going home to get nursed up after his illness
and will be comforted by the new possession. I expect
to be gone a week. Bessie will have a friend staying
with her, but you will drop in once in a while, won’t
you, to see how she is getting along?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen promised. Then she took up the violin, held
it close for a moment, reverently kissed it, handed it
back to Mr. Todd, and with eyes full of tears, hurried
from the church. It was a bigger sacrifice than
she at first realized in her moment of exaltation, but
it was done, and now to put aside sentimentality and
turn to stern duty. She mopped her eyes, threw back
her head, and marched steadily up street to the doctor’s,
entering his office as he was preparing to leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, miss,” was his greeting, “where have you
been gadding? I was just wondering if you would
get back in time to go to the hospital with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I went up home for a little while, and then I
stopped in to see Mr. Todd at the church. He is going
away to-night, and wants me to take the organ
while he is gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old Jeremy going to have a holiday, is he? That’s
good. Where’s he going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the city to visit an old friend, and also to take
my violin to the person who has bought it.” Ellen
thought she might as well put a bold face upon the
matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your violin? Oh, yes, I did hear that you had
one given you. Don’t you want to play on it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not have time for that and for the organ,
too; besides, I don’t believe Cousin Rindy ever could
stand hearing me squeaking out scales and exercises
every day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph!” The doctor nodded thoughtfully.
“Didn’t I hear something about it having belonged to
your father?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen’s lip trembled, and she did not trust herself
to do more than nod affirmatively as the doctor shot
her a keen glance. But she soon controlled herself
and spoke steadily as she asked, “How long will it
be before Cousin Rindy can leave the hospital?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In about a couple of weeks, I should say, but
don’t you worry any about that; she is better off there
than she would be anywhere else, and the longer you
make your visit to Caro the better she and the rest of
us will like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s mighty nice for you to say, but I know
Cousin Rindy will be fretting till she gets back home;
she does so hate to be idle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good rest won’t hurt her, and as for you, it
isn’t to be supposed that you can take on housekeeping
and nursing, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I shall have to, for a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll see about that. Are you ready to go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy’s face brightened as Ellen entered the
room. These daily visits meant everything to her.
Ellen saved up bits of gossip to tell her, cut out jokes
from the newspapers, brought some interesting story
to read to her, and cudgelled her brains for some new
means of entertainment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here’s the useless old hulk still cumbering
the earth,” was Miss Rindy’s greeting on this special
day. “If Sam Rowe doesn’t get me out of this room
pretty quick, I’ll have to mortgage my house and sell
my old carcass to the doctors for what it would bring
after I’m gone, though, being damaged goods, it
wouldn’t bring much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can you conjure up such ghastly things?”
said Ellen, stooping to kiss her. “In this room you
are going to stay till you are able to go home. Moreover,
you are not to fret over it another minute. Look
at this, if you please.” She produced her check and
gave it into her cousin’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you get this? What have you been
doing? Who is this Reed Marshall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve been doing nothing disgraceful. Just keep
quiet and I’ll tell you all about it,” which she proceeded
to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But your father’s violin! I’m not going to consent
to you selling it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t help yourself; the deed is done. Now
listen to me, Cousin Rindy, and don’t work yourself
up into a pepper-jig. You know perfectly well that
the violin is a useless possession so far as I am concerned,
and one who is always discoursing upon usefulness
and scorning sentimentality should encourage
me in getting rid of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not for my benefit; the price should be set
aside for your own educational advantages.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Educational advantages go to grass! But for you
I might this minute be scrubbing down the back stairs
of an orphan asylum. Do allow me the happiness of
paying a little toward my debts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I know how delighted you were to have the
violin, and it grieves me to have you give it up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am surprised at you, Orinda Crump; the idea of
you encouraging me in maudlin sentiment, a practical
body like you. Now don’t let’s hear any more about
it. I have you where you can’t badger me, so let’s
accept what Heaven has sent and say Thank you to
Reed Marshall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is he? You haven’t told me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The young man who blacked up and came to Mr.
Barstow’s party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How old is he, and what does he look like?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Haven’t an idea’ answers both those questions;
you remember I told you I never saw him really. Dr.
Rowe says that Miss Sophia Garrett has been here to
see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she came out this morning with a string of
gossip that would reach from here to town. What’s
this about Jeremy Todd? Sophy says he is going to
the city, neglecting his work at the church and running
up useless expense,” Miss Rindy laughed as she
quoted Miss Sophia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How in the world did she find out that he is going?
I only knew it to-day, myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trust Sophy for finding out things, and her tales
never lose by the telling. So he really is going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he is going to visit Mr. Barstow, who is an
old friend, and as he is to be the bearer of the violin,
Mr. Barstow insists upon paying all his expenses, and
I am to take the church music while he is away, which
will be only over one Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t that just like Sophy to make a mountain out
of a mole-hill? She reminds me of those scientists to
whom you give a bone and they will construct a mastodon.
I can’t help going back to that check, Ellen.
You are sure it isn’t too much? I’d hate to have you
accept more than the thing is worth. It seems a
monstrous price to pay for a violin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a very fine one, and Mr. Todd says it is really
worth more, so does Mr. Marshall say so in his note.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t bring the note for me to see. Why
not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I was in a hurry and it didn’t seem worth
while,” Ellen answered casually, wondering just why
she didn’t want her cousin to see it. “The check was
the main thing. I am sure it will pay your hospital
expenses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not the doctor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps not, but I have another scheme for that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sha’n’t tell you till I see how it is going to work
out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy drew the girl’s head down as she rose
to go. “You are a good child, Ellen,” she whispered,
“and I am thankful you are here instead of scrubbing
down the back stairs of some Home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So am I,” Ellen whispered back. Then the doctor
and the nurse appeared, and in a few minutes Ellen
was on her way back to town.</p>

<p class='c009'>During these daily trips back and forth to the hospital
she had many confidential talks with the doctor,
who was always friendliness itself, and one day came
an opportunity to lay before him the scheme of which
she had spoken to Miss Rindy. It was when he spoke
of the pressure of his work, and of how difficult he
found it to get time for correspondence and the making
out of bills.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see why I couldn’t do some of that,” Ellen
spoke up. “If you would let me pay our bill that
way, I’d be very grateful, Doctor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What bill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your bill for attending Cousin Rindy. You go
to see her every day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I visit the hospital every day, and it is a pity if
I am not allowed to drop in for a few minutes to see
an old friend. There isn’t going to be any bill sent
to Rindy Crump from my office. She can pay the hospital
charges, or, rather, you can, but that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know perfectly well she will never consent
to that. She is a great stickler for paying what she
owes, and she will be perfectly miserable if you don’t
send her a bill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor laughed. “I wish all my patients would
have a touch of that kind of misery. My soul! Why
wasn’t Rindy’s father a doctor so she could claim
professional services as her right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he wasn’t, and she can’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you’d call that a laconic fact. I reckon
I can be as stiff as she can, and I tell you there isn’t
going to be any bill from me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, we won’t call it a bill, but just an exchange
of courtesies. You work for us; I work for
you. When shall I begin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor almost allowed his car to run into a
ditch as he turned to look at his companion. “You
do beat the Dutch!” he exclaimed. “I’m not going
to let you work for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sorry you scorn my services. Perhaps you think
I’m not equal to the task. I write a fair hand, and
can tackle a typewriter on a pinch. If you think I will
fall down on that job, some morning you’ll find me
scrubbing off your back porch or sweeping down the
walk; I’m bound to get even with you some way.”
Ellen’s thoughts harked back to the conversation with
her cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor was in a brown study the rest of the
way home. After he had helped Ellen from the car
she stood for a moment and laid her hand on his
coat sleeve, looking up pleadingly into his face.
“Please, Doctor,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor laid his gloved hand upon hers. “Ellen
North,” he said, “I’d hug you right here in front of
my own windows if Sophy Garrett didn’t live across
the street. You’re a witch. I give in. We’ll tackle
those books and that pile of letters to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d love to hug you if it wasn’t for Miss Sophia,”
returned Ellen gayly.</p>

<p class='c009'>In two weeks Miss Rindy was back in her own
home, which was swept and garnished from garret to
basement. The sweeping was not done by Ellen alone,
for neighbors to the right and left lent a hand, and
the garnishing promised to be overdone when anybody
who had a blossoming plant brought it to adorn
Miss Rindy’s room. Moreover, all sorts of contribution
in the way of food were handed in, so, for a
few days at least, there was no danger that the two
cousins would suffer from hunger.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as soon as this first excitement passed, everything
settled down to a dull routine, and it was a
tired Ellen who went to bed each night. From early
morn till late at night every moment was filled, and
many, many were the steps she took. Miss Rindy,
more or less compliant when she was under the care
of a regular nurse, became, as is usually the case in
convalescence, a difficult patient, with all sorts of
whimseys and unnecessary demands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the long strain Ellen, too, grew irritable, and
more than once rushed from her cousin’s room in
tears. It was just after one of these tempests that
Dr. Rowe happened to come in. Ellen opened the
door for him. He looked at her keenly as he laid
aside his hat and overcoat, then he took her by the
chin and tipped back her head. “What’s the matter?”
he asked sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing much,” answered Ellen, the tears still too
near the surface not to suffuse her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s got to be a stop to this all work and no
play business,” said the doctor. “Get on your things
and I’ll take you for a ride.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there is so much to do, and who will stay
with Cousin Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind about having so much to do, and as
for Rindy, it will do her good to have a quiet hour
in which to meditate upon her sins. Leave things
where she can get at them, and she’ll get along. She
is not liable to fall down in a fit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen still hesitated, and, seeing this, the doctor
promised to send Caro to stay with Miss Rindy, so
Ellen finally went, still feeling rather conscience-stricken.
“I feel as if I were neglecting my duty,”
she sighed as she climbed into the car by the
doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The trouble with you is that you are trying to
cultivate a Puritan conscience,” returned he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wouldn’t think so if you could have heard
me ‘sass’ Cousin Rindy this morning. She is so
notional and exacting sometimes, that I flare up and
the fur flies. I suppose we get on each other’s nerves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly. Do you know, Miss North, that you
have worked out that bill of mine? I wanted to talk
to you about it; that’s why I got you off to myself
to-day. When Caro is around she hangs on your
neck and talks nonsense, while Rindy monopolizes the
conversation when she is present. Do you want to
keep on doing my sums for me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I do if you want me to.” Ellen had been
taking home the work and doing it in the evenings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now that we are quits of professional services
I can pay you something, not a munificent sum,
but enough to pay some one to help you out with the
work once in a while and give you more freedom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, doctor, how good you are! You know Beulah
Fitchett does our washing, and I am sure she
would be glad to come oftener.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that’s settled. I am getting up some statistics
for an article I want to write for a medical
magazine, so you can help with that; and I want to
make a special report to the health department, so
that will keep us busy for a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cheered by her drive and heartened by the prospect
of relief from hard, rough work, Ellen returned to
face the future bravely. Miss Rindy improved steadily,
and soon was able to get about on crutches and
to do many little things. Beulah responded with
alacrity to the invitation to come and help with the
housework, and while she never quite satisfied Miss
Rindy, being sketchy in her performances and slow in
her movements, nevertheless she was good-natured,
honest, and clean. Moreover, though she had a high
opinion of her own importance and had to be managed,
Miss Rindy knew how to get along with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I always invite her to do things and never order
her,” she told Bessie Todd; “and she is such a source
of entertainment that I would put up with a good
deal for the sake of having her around. She told me
to-day that her whole name was Beulahland, but they
called her Beulah for short.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great big fat thing; I wouldn’t be bothered with
her,” responded Bessie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s because you haven’t a proper sense of humor,”
returned Miss Rindy. “A laugh is worth more
to me than servile respect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Beulah, being “invited” to cook, wash, iron, and
clean, stayed on, and the days went less heavily for
Ellen. To be sure, she often sighed over the uninteresting
matter contained in the doctor’s notes, and
wearied of statistics, still at sight of Beulah’s ponderous
figure and smiling black face, her thanks went
flying heavenward for the means which enabled her to
pay for this helper, and the tangles in her temper
smoothed out accordingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, once in a while the effort to appreciate
plain living and high thinking was too much for her,
and she so yearned for the flesh-pots, represented by
those things which Frank’s attentions promised, that
she smiled upon him graciously and built foolish
castles and saw herself joint owner of the red automobile
and mistress of an ornate abode.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe I am developing into a flirt, and at seventeen
that is pretty bad,” she confessed to Caro.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caro giggled and said: “Go ahead, honey. I’d
love you to be Florence’s sister-in-law; she would be
so pleased.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now you start my compunctions to raging,” cried
Ellen, “for you know I’d be far from pleased. I suppose
sisters-in-law can’t be eliminated even from daydreams.
Perhaps one could stand Frank, but his family!”
She made an expressive gesture and Caro giggled
again. Therefore to Frank’s surprise and dismay
she turned him the cold shoulder the next time they
met, while she did penance by working doubly hard
the following day.</p>

    <div>A SPRING VISITOR</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Long before all this Jeremy Todd had returned
from the city to report that he had delivered the
violin safely into the hands of Mr. Barstow, who
would keep it till Reed Marshall came back to claim
it. A royal time Jeremy had had with his old friend.
“That visit has just made me over,” declared the good
old man. “You remember that line in one of Richard
Watson Gilder’s poems: ‘Now who can take from us
what has been ours?’ That often comforts when the
dark days are upon us. No one can ever take from
me the joy of those days I have had with Peter
Barstow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did he seem chagrined that I kept his gift such a
little while,—that I was ready to part with it so
soon?” Ellen asked wistfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not he. Don Pedro is a very understanding person,
you know. I told him what you said about selfish
sentimentality and he was much struck with the
phrase.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was borrowed from Cousin Rindy; don’t give
me the credit for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sounds like her. Well, my dear, sometimes our
sacrifices come back to us in the form of joys. One
never knows what flower may spring from a chance
seed. These are pretty dark days for you, but the
spring is on its way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And truly the spring was bringing the flower of a
happy surprise to Ellen, for one day, when she was
gathering some sprays of forsythia with which to
adorn the table, she saw Jeremy Todd limping up the
street toward her, and by his side walked a girl whose
face and form looked very familiar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen dropped her flowers on the grass and ran down
to the gate to meet the two. “It is, it is Mabel Wickham!”
she cried. “How do you happen to be in
Marshville?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ask Mr. Todd,” replied Mabel laughing. “I hope
I have not come because of vain imaginings. May we
come in and tell you all about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed you may.” Ellen opened the gate. “You
don’t know how glad I am to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I am overjoyed to see you, but I want to
see your cousin, too. May I? Is she able to receive
strangers? Can she leave her room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She not only leaves her room but gets all over
the house on crutches. She is the pluckiest thing ever,
and scorns being an invalid. Come in and I will call
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such a dear, quaint little old house as it is; I just
love little houses,” said Mabel enthusiastically as she
entered the hall; but she laughed when Ellen tragically
indicated the ornaments on the mantel and the pictures
on the walls.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can steep your soul in the beauties of our
art treasures while I go to hunt up Cousin Rindy,” she
remarked with a twist of a smile as she left the room,
wondering meanwhile just what had brought Mabel
to Marshville, and why she was in such a hurry to see
Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was not long left in ignorance, for, as soon as
Miss Rindy had clumped into the room and the usual
forms of introduction were over, Mabel plunged into
her subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, Miss Crump,” she began, “put your mind
in a receptive attitude, for if you don’t fall in with
my plan I shall faint on the spot. To begin away
back at the beginning: my grandmother loves to plan
things months ahead, and so she commenced as soon
as Christmas was over to talk about her summer plans.
Year after year she has gone to a very fashionable,
but deadly stupid, watering place where she could sit
on the porch of a big hotel all day, do fancy work,
and gossip with the other guests while they all rocked
placidly. Well, I have stood it just about as long as
I can, and this year, being of age, I made up my mind
to rebel. My grandmother is neither old nor decrepit,
and doesn’t need me in the least, for she will have
hosts of friends in the same house, so I want to go
off where I can enjoy myself in my own way. Last
year one of my great-aunts died and left me a little
cottage on an island off the Maine coast, and that is
where I am crazy to go. Now this is where you come
in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where we come in?” exclaimed Ellen excitedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Exactly. Just hold your horses till my tale is
told. Of course Gran held up her hands in holy
horror when I suggested such a thing. The simple
life has no appeal for her, and you would suppose the
fisherfolk on the island went around in goatskins
and armed with spears. Well, when I found she was
deaf to all my blandishments I posted off to New York
to my aunt, Mrs. Everleigh, who has more influence
over Granny than any one else. Like the dear thing
that she is, she listened to my tale of woe and promised
to stand by me, so we planned out a course of
action which promises to be successful if you will cooperate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I may be very stupid, but I still fail to see our part
in it,” Miss Rindy spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will see in a minute, dear lady. There were
two or three points to be settled before we could approach
Granny again. We must have counter-arguments
to meet hers. First, there must be some one
provided to take my place, and we decided that a
pretty, beguiling, and foolish little cousin, a débutante
of next winter’s vintage, would be just the one, and
we knew she would jump at the chance. Next, it
would never do for me to go off into forest jungles
and deserts wild without a proper chaperon; a cave
man might grab me up at any moment and make off
with me in a birch-bark canoe. Granny is still so
unmodern as to believe in chaperons, you see, and she
is mighty particular as to their quality. Well, we
were mulling over this question when we happened
to go to Mr. Barstow’s studio one afternoon. I was
so full of my subject that I was ready to talk about
it to every one, and I told my troubles to dear Mr.
Barstow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Don Pedro, he would be just the one you
would tell them to,” commented Ellen. “I haven’t
a doubt but he could point to some way out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He certainly did, so now it is up to you two.
Oh, won’t you go with me? We could have such
heavenly times, Ellen, and I am sure that invigorating
air would do you a world of good, Miss Crump, make
you over in fact. Please, please, don’t turn me down.
I don’t mean that you are to decide at once. I shall
be here till to-morrow, and you can sleep on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do tell me what Mr. Barstow said,” Ellen urged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He sat thinking over the question when I put it
to him, and all at once he looked up with that quizzical
smile of his and asked: ‘What’s the matter with
Ellen North and that fine cousin of hers? Why
wouldn’t they be just the ones?’ I nearly fell on his
neck. Then I rushed over and dragged Aunt Nell
away from the people she was sitting with, and we all
talked so fast that we had to begin all over again;
but finally Mr. Barstow had the floor, and he proposed
that I come down here and talk it over with you.
He thought Mr. and Mrs. Todd might take me in for
a day or two, which they have very kindly done, and
that Mr. Todd would meet me, so here I am, thanks
to the two blessed men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But are you sure your grandmother will agree?”
inquired Miss Rindy with caution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, I know she will, for Aunt Nell came back
with me to Baltimore and we talked it all over. I
think Gran is rather looking forward to watching
Fan’s flirtations. The only thing that is uncertain is
the matter of a cook, that is, provided you go. We
could take our meals at a boarding-house, but it would
be more fun to have them at home, don’t you think?
I wouldn’t mind a course in domestic science myself,
and it would be rather jolly to go to the store and
pick out things, you and I, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It all sounds so perfectly heavenly,” murmured
Ellen. “I’ve never spent a summer at the seashore,
and I have always longed to go to Maine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must understand,” Mabel went on hesitatingly,
“that there will not be the slightest expense
attached to the undertaking, and that whatever salary
should be attached to the office of chaperon will be
yours, Miss Crump. You will be my guests, of
course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy’s head went up. “I could not think of
demanding a salary. To be your guests would be a
privilege sufficient to balance matters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel looked helplessly at Ellen, who shook her
head warningly. One must not antagonize Miss
Rindy in matters of this sort. It was evident that
she was disposed to think favorably of the proposition,
and of Mabel, so the latter switched off to another
subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One lovely thing about going up to this island is
that we don’t have to bother about clothes. We can
dress any old way we choose. We shall need some
warm things, I warn you, for it never gets very hot,
except sometimes in the middle of the day, and even
then you can count upon a breeze from the sea. I
was there for a week once, and I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One would suppose it was all settled,” said Miss
Rindy smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but it is, at least nearly, isn’t it?” said Ellen,
throwing her arms around her cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you to-morrow. How is an old hoppety-go-quick
like me to take that long journey on crutches?
When do you expect to go, Miss Wickham?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s perfectly lovely up there in June. Could you
go as early as the middle of that month?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll be giving up your crutches and be walking
with a cane by that time,” Ellen broke in; “the doctor
said so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You could go all the way by water if you liked,
or we could motor up. At all events it would be made
as easy a journey for you as possible,” Mabel promised.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy only nodded reflectively. “We’ll let
the matter rest for the present,” she decided, and
nothing further would she say.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Todd had taken his departure before Mabel had
started her explanations, and now Ellen bore her
friend up to her own room, where they chattered like
magpies while Ellen made ready to go out with Mabel
to show her the town.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is superfluous to say that for the rest of the day
the two were in a wild state of excitement. While
Ellen despised snobbishness, she nevertheless could not
but feel an inward pride in her new friend, not so
much because of her wealth, but because of her little
high-bred air, her gracious, unaffected manner, free
from any <i>gaucherie</i>. Mabel could not lay claims to
great beauty, but her small, well-set head, her fine
carriage, her wide-open, frank, blue eyes set rather
widely apart, the unmistakable elegance of her dress,
all distinguished her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caro at first was disposed to be jealous, but was
soon won over by Mabel’s sweetness, and was the first
to sound her praises to an eager circle, Florence Ives
among them, and it must be confessed that Caro was
overweeningly boastful in the presence of this young
person. “I always told you that Ellen had lovely
friends in the city,” she said triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe I’ll give a little tea to-morrow and ask
Ellen to bring Miss Wickham,” said Florence, much
impressed, and always on the lookout for desirable
acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can spare yourself the trouble,” replied Caro
coolly, “for she leaves to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O dear!” sighed Florence, and was further
chagrined when Frank reported that he, with Claude
Fawcett and Julius Safford, had been asked to take
supper at Dr. Rowe’s to meet Miss Wickham. In this
small town the old-fashioned custom of a midday
dinner and a substantial supper was still in vogue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course Ellen will be there,” said Frank complacently,
and again Florence sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were always jolly times for the young people
when they met at Dr. Rowe’s. The doctor himself was
a jovial soul, while Mrs. Rowe was sympathetic and
motherly, never frowning upon youthful nonsense, and
always ready to indulge her only child in dispensing
such hospitality as pleased her. Consequently Caro’s
invitations were never refused, for, as the boys said,
“You are sure of good eats when you go to the
Rowes’”; and with boys this counted for much,
“greedy creatures as they are,” Caro was wont to
remark.</p>

<p class='c009'>They never hesitated to express their appreciation,
however, and declared it was not all loaves and fishes
which brought them to the house. “You are such a
good sport, Caro,” Clyde told her, “and you don’t
treat us like company. We don’t have to just sit on
chairs and pay compliments; you don’t even mind a
little rough-house as long as we don’t break up the
furniture, and you don’t get mad if we jolly you, so
that’s why we always like to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel was told all this when at first she hesitated
at going to the house of utter strangers. “I’m here
for such a short time,” she said, “and I don’t know
them at all. Should I be so informal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “I think there spoke your grandmother.
Don’t you like being informal? I thought
you did. Caro is a dear, a sort of primrose-on-the-river’s-brim
person, but overflowing with good-will.
The whole family are my best friends, excepting dear
Jeremy Todd, of course, and because of that you are
their friend, too. The boys are just nice, everyday
boys. Frank tries to be grown up sometimes, but
the others are nothing but playfellows, and we all have
mighty good times together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It all sounds very refreshing, so if you think it
will be all right I’ll be glad to go,” Mabel decided.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore Caro had her triumph, and no one could
say that it was a disappointing evening. Caro charged
each boy separately that he was not to “sit up and
pay compliments,” but must make it as jolly as possible.
“Please don’t be stiff,” she begged. “Tell
funny stories, and if it helps to break the ice you may
jolly me all you choose.” And the boys obeyed her to
the letter, so that Mabel said she had never laughed
so much in all her life, and that she wouldn’t have
missed that supper for the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am so tired of bridge parties and the grown-up
doings that Gran loves to force me into. She is a
perfect dear, and adores me, but she is, oh, so conventional
and I get so tired of <i>p</i>’s and <i>q</i>’s; that is why
I long to get away to more simplicity this summer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you ever been to Beatty’s Island?” Ellen
inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Once, but only for a week, and that when I was
a little girl, but I remember how fascinating a place it
seemed to me then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This talk took place while the two were putting on
their wraps; then Caro appeared, and the subject was
dropped, for not a word was to be spoken to others
of the summer plans till they were really settled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank and Clyde saw the girls home, when they
parted, not to meet again till the next morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll come over right after breakfast,” Mabel
promised. “Please don’t settle anything till I get
there,” after which rather cryptic remark only goodnights
were said.</p>

    <div>WHERE THE SUMMER WAS SPENT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was with difficulty that Ellen refrained from pouring
forth the next morning the eager question,
Are we going? And that she might not yield to the
temptation she jabbered away while she was helping
with breakfast, and gave a detailed account of the
doings of the night before. Once in a while Miss
Rindy gave her a quizzical look, but made no reference
to the matter of such great interest to both of
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had just risen from the table when in rushed
Mabel. “I couldn’t wait another minute,” she cried
breathlessly. Then dropping on her knees at Miss
Rindy’s feet and clasping her hands pleadingly, she
exclaimed, “Please, dear, good lady, don’t keep me
in suspense any longer. Tell me that you’re not going
to turn me down, but that you are going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Going? Where?” answered Miss Rindy teasingly
with the same quizzical smile she had given
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Beatty’s Island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s the name of the place you were talking
about yesterday, is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t I tell you?” Mabel was still on her knees.
“I sha’n’t get up till you say you are going,” she
continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be too bad to allow you to endure such
a penance, so——” Miss Rindy paused and continued
to smile down on the supplicant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So—so——” Mabel waited a moment expectantly.
“You are going, aren’t you?” she said at
last.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Miss Rindy answered, “I are, you are, we
are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Up sprang Mabel to give her a violent hug. “You
dear, dear thing!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, here, look out,” cried Miss Rindy. “I don’t
allow such demonstrations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must do something to express my joy,” said
Mabel. “‘My heart with rapture thrills, and dances
with the daffodils.’ Be a daffodil, Ellen.” She caught
Ellen around the waist and the two went off in a wild
dance, scaring Wipers out of his wits, and causing
Miss Rindy to cry out, “If this is the way you two
are going to behave, I’ll take back what I said and will
stay at home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll be good, indeed I will,” promised Mabel, dropping
into a chair and folding her hands meekly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let’s talk business,” returned Miss Rindy,
herself taking a seat. “You spoke of taking a cook
along. Would it be possible to engage one of your
grandmother’s servants? If her house is to be closed,
it might be a good idea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel shook her head. “Wouldn’t do at all. They
are all so high and mighty that any one of them would
leave on the first boat. They would scorn a simple
way of living, and would require all sorts of things
that Beatty’s Island doesn’t furnish. No, no, we must
have a different sort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not Beulah?” Ellen spoke up. “She is a
nice comfortable kind, used to our ways, and I believe
she would be willing to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is she? Where is she?” asked Mabel eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll be along after a while; she is not one given
to undue haste, but she gets there in course of time.
Slow and steady wins the race, you know. She is no
sylph, and large bodies move slowly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t care how big she is, so she does our work,
is a good cook, and is clean and honest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is all that. Her chief fault is an overgrown
idea of her own importance, but Cousin Rindy knows
how to manage her, and it would be all right if we
could induce her to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And stay,” put in Miss Rindy grimly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The upshot of the matter was that Beulah consented
to go, though not without some demur. “It terrible
fur off, ain’t it?” she protested. “Are it crost dem
waters where you went to tend de sojers, Miss
Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O dear, no,” Miss Rindy reassured her. “I was
days in crossing, and here we shall leave one afternoon
and get there the next day at noon, Miss Wickham
tells us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where we stays at night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On the train if we go by rail; on the boat if we
go by water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Beulah considered this, and Mabel struck in with
the conciliatory question, “Which way would you
rather go, Beulah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will go the way we do unless she prefers to
go up alone, in which case she can choose her own
route,” said Miss Rindy severely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beulah’s feathers drooped at once. “’Deed, Miss
Rindy, I skeered to go all dat long ways by mahse’f;
I goes when yuh does, an’ trabbles de same. Dat is,”
she continued, her dignity again rising, “if so be I
does go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know you’re going, Beulah,” said Miss Rindy
decidedly. “You wouldn’t throw away such a good
chance as this. Of course you’re going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yas’m, I ’specs I is,” replied Beulah meekly.</p>

<p class='c009'>So that matter was settled, though Beulah changed
her mind more than once before June. “She teeters
up and down like a seesaw,” declared Miss Rindy.
“I don’t believe she has a notion of not going; it is
only that she wants to impress us with her importance.
I’ll fix her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And fix her she did, for one morning when Beulah
was declaring that she didn’t know after all that she
would go,—it was so far,—Miss Rindy turned upon
her. “Now, look here, Beulah,” she said, “I’ve had
enough of this will and won’t. You’ve got to make
up your mind this very minute or I’ll write to Miss
Wickham and tell her to put an advertisement for a
cook in the Baltimore papers. No fear that she won’t
get plenty of answers. No more nonsense, you understand.
Now, which is it, go or stay?” Miss Rindy
fixed her with a glittering eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beulah fumbled with the edge of her apron, turning
her head this way and that. “Yuh so up an’ down,
Miss Rindy,” she made complaint. “I nuver see anybody
with such millingtary ways. I ’specs yuh learns
’em whilst yuh was follerin’ eroun’ dem sojers. It’s
jes’ lak yuh stands me up aginst a wall an’ says,
‘Shoot!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shoot!” cried Miss Rindy so suddenly that Beulah
gave an elephantine jump.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Law, Miss Rindy,” she cried, “yuh skeers me
outen a year’s growth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe that would be a good thing to do, if it
affected your girth,” returned Miss Rindy laughing.
“Now, look here, Beulah, you know that you’re nothing
but a poor worm; that hymn you were singing
this morning says so, and the way you crawl anybody
would know it was true. We’re willing to take you
with us, worm though you be, but if you don’t want
to go, just say so at once without any more shilly-shallying,
but I shall have my opinion of you, and it
won’t be only a worm that I shall call you to your
class leader. You gave me your word that you were
going, and you know what happens to those that don’t
speak the truth; if you don’t know, just look in Revelation,
twenty-first chapter, twenty-seventh verse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Law, Miss Rindy, yuh sho does skeer me; yuh
wuss’n de preacher.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad of it; you need some one to be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Beulah stood, still fingering her apron. Presently
she asked, “Which a-way yuh is goin’, Miss Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The quickest way, I think. We can take the Hell
Gate route and reach Portland early in the morning.”
Miss Rindy’s lips twitched as she said this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Den I stays. I don’t go no such way. No, ma’am,
it’s too dangersome. I don’t keer what the preacher
say. I doesn’t trus’ mah body near no hell gate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy laughed. “You are a silly creature,
Beulah; that’s only the name of what used to be a
dangerous spot in the East River. It is perfectly safe.
You’ll be on the train, and won’t know when you get
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>However it required a deal of explanation to convince
Beulah, but finally she gave in, and later in the
day was inspired to sing with great earnestness, “The
gospel train are comin’; I hears it close to han’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime Ellen had made known to her
various friends that she was to be Mabel Wickham’s
guest for the summer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will be perfectly lovely for you, but very sorrowful
for me,” sighed Caro. However, she did not
delay in spreading the news, specially delighting in
giving the information to Florence Ives.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ain’t it a shame she didn’t stay long enough for
me to give her a tea?” said Florence. “Then she
might have invited me, too. I suppose it’s to Bar
Harbor they go. I wisht we could take a cottage there,
but Papa says it’s too highbrow for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Caro did not enlighten her further, though later on
Frank did, and when she learned the location of
Mabel’s cottage her desire toward Maine was considerably
lessened. “No wonder she was willing to invite
Ellen to a stupid little place like that,” she scoffed.
“I know I wouldn’t want to go, and I’m glad I’m not
invited.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t be afraid that you’d have a chance to
turn down any invitation of Miss Wickham’s,” returned
Frank scornfully. “She doesn’t run with girls
of your type.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pff!” ejaculated Florence loftily. “I reckon I’m
good enough to go wherever you go, and anyway it
is a nice way you have of speaking of your sister.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may be <i>nouveau riche</i>, but I hope I’m neither
a grafter nor a toady,” replied Frank, a remark which
made no impression whatever upon Florence, but
which in the future gave Frank some hours of indecision
in his effort to stand up for his principles.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of Ellen’s friends rejoiced with her, however,
chief among them being Jeremy Todd and Dr. Rowe.
“It will do you a world of good, both you and Rindy,”
said the latter. “I couldn’t have recommended a better
plan.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so when the time came Ellen started off with a
light heart. By this time Miss Rindy was able to get
around with the use of only a cane, and was able to
take her usual dominant place in the household. The
neighbors promised to look after Wipers, and everything
seemed to be in readiness the morning of the
start. But where was Beulah?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now isn’t that just like her?” exclaimed Miss
Rindy, who had been fuming and fretting for the past
hour. “I suppose she thinks the train will wait for
her, she’s that important.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s plenty of time yet,” Ellen tried to soothe
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There may be, but one can never tell what delays
may crop up. I’d rather be half an hour too early
than one minute too late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were standing on the porch, the door locked
and the key in Ellen’s hand, ready to be delivered into
Jeremy Todd’s keeping, when they saw Beulah lumbering
up the street and laden down with various
equipments for the journey. Her fellow-travellers
hurried down to the gate to meet her. “I don’t know
why I didn’t tell her to meet us at the railway station,”
complained Miss Rindy; “it would have saved time.
Hurry up, Beulah,” she called out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Deed, Miss Rindy, I comin’ fas’ as I kin,” responded
Beulah breathlessly. “I so borned down
with all dese yere bun’les an’ bags.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy looked aghast as she saw what Beulah
carried: a dilapidated suit-case, bursting at corners and
tied up with various assortments of string, a discarded
cover of a sofa pillow, tied around the top to make a
bag, various heterogeneous newspaper bundles of different
shapes and sizes kept together by strips of
muslin, the string having given out, and, last, a paper
bag containing, supposedly, a hat which was secured
to Beulah’s sleeve by a large safety-pin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My fathers, Beulah!” exclaimed Miss Rindy.
“You can’t travel all the way to Maine with that collection.
Why didn’t you put them all in one bag or
trunk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t have nothin’ but dis yere suit-case, an’ dey
wasn’t no papers big enough to pack uverthing in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, why didn’t you send some of the stuff by
parcel post?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’ trus’ my bes’ clothes to no mail bag. I
sees how dey flings ’em eroun’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You might have worn the hat, at least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W’ar mah bes’ hat in dem dirty cyars? Um-um!
Why, Miss Rindy, it trim’ with pink roses an’ white
gauzy ribbon, an’ yuh knows what it look lak when
we gets dere. I pays two ninety-eight fo’ dat hat, an’
I ain’t spile it for nobody.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy hastily consulted her wrist watch.
“Well, all is I am not going to have us all disgraced
when we meet Miss Wickham in New York. Open
the door, Ellen. No, I’ll go. You come with me,
Beulah. There is an old steamer trunk in the attic,
and into that these things must go, train or no train.
Run on ahead, Ellen, and see if you can get Mike
Reilly to come after the trunk. Don’t lose a minute;
we may be able to make the train yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen started off at a run, and did not stop when
she heard some one behind her shouting her name, but
she came to a halt when an automobile drew up to
the sidewalk and Barry Dove-Hale jumped out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you are in a hurry,” he said. “Hop in and
I’ll take you anywhere you want to go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen scrambled into the car and explained the situation.
Immediately Barry turned his car around.
“No use hunting up Mike,” he declared. “He is an
uncertain quantity unless you order him the day before
you want him. We’ll go back, pick up the trunk,
and I’ll take the whole outfit down to the station. If
the trunk is ready, we can make it. Is it a big one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, only a small steamer trunk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I can easily manage it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You simply will save our lives,” Ellen said fervently.
“It came to a question whether we should
miss the train or miss taking Beulah. We simply
couldn’t stand appearing in New York with Beulah’s
impedimenta.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Hale laughed. “I don’t blame you. Just leave
the whole business to me and I’ll promise to see you
through. I’m used to doing things on short order, as
you would find out if you lived at our house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He dashed up the stairs, Ellen after him, as soon
as they reached the house. Miss Rindy was just locking
the trunk, which Mr. Hale promptly shouldered,
and in a few minutes they were at the station, Beulah
still clinging to the bag which contained her rose-wreathed
hat, for this she refused to relinquish. The
train was in sight when they reached the platform, so
there was little time for good-bys. Caro was there
to give Ellen a parting embrace, Frank came to the
fore with magazines and a box of candy, to Jeremy
promptly was handed over the key. With the use of
her cane Miss Rindy nimbly mounted the steps of the
car, Beulah was boosted after her, and Ellen, waving
farewells, stood in the doorway as the train moved
off. It was fortunate she was there, for at the very
last moment Mr. Hale ran alongside to thrust the
check for the trunk into her hand. “Just did make
it,” he cried, then stood back to make a farewell gesture
and they were off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen sank into the seat by her cousin’s side.
“What a relief,” she sighed. “It was a close shave,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Couldn’t have been much closer. It’s just as I
always say, Ellen; it is safer to be half an hour too
early than one minute too late. If we had not been
prompt ourselves, there’s no telling what might have
happened. It’s lucky we checked our own trunks yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Beulah, in serene possession of her hat, sat complacently
looking out of the window. From time to
time she produced from some obscure pocket some
article of food of which she partook with evident enjoyment.
First it was a banana, then a ginger snap,
next some bread and cheese, an apple, a strip of pink
and white candy, then peanuts. To enliven the journey,
once in a while she waddled to the water cooler.
When the train boy came through she supplied herself
with various other comestibles and began all over
again. To eat was to live, in Beulah’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll probably acquire a larger appetite up in
that bracing climate,” Ellen whispered to her cousin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let us be thankful that it is Miss Wickham
and not we who will pay the store bills,” replied Miss
Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were joined by Miss Wickham in New York,
and by noon the next day were aboard a small
steamer which wound its way through a many-islanded
bay to a quiet cove, and presently Beatty’s Island was
reached. A tall, stalwart old man with weather-beaten
face, shrewd blue eyes, and white chin-whiskers was
on the lookout for them. “Cap’n Belah, Cap’n
Belah,” Mabel called, “were you looking for us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He strode up to her. “Wal, here you be,” he
greeted her by saying. “Cal’lated you’d get here on
this bo-at. Got any traps?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have trunks and these hand-bags.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I d’know as I can lug the hull passel of you,” he
said as he surveyed Beulah’s proportions. “I ain’t
got any insurance on my kerridge, and I ain’t bought
myself an aut’mobile yet.” His eyes twinkled as he
said this. “I’ll get Sim to fetch up your trunks, and
them as is good walkers can go on to the cawtage
while I look after the lame and lazy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll walk, Miss North and I, for I remember
it isn’t far. How are your family, Cap’n Belah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re pretty spry. My woman hove her ankle
out a while ago, but she’s getting on pretty good. She
done it up in hot molasses and salt and she says it
don’t hurt a mite. Wal, who’s going to git in first?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Crump,” Mabel said promptly. “Miss
Crump, this is Cap’n Belah Simpson, who is going to
help us out of all our difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cap’n Belah grinned and jerked his head toward
Beulah. “Is she one of ’em?” he asked in a stage
whisper, but he helped her into the carriage and stowed
away the hand luggage while Ellen and Mabel started
up a long flight of stairs, past blossoming lilacs
and apple trees, although it was mid-June. A little
farther away the road turned and they caught sight of
a wide expanse of blue sea, embraced on one side by a
curving line of shore, but on the other side stretching
out into what seemed limitless space.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the house!” cried Mabel, quickening her
steps as two or three gray roofs appeared over the
brow of the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which? Which?” questioned Ellen eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The one nearest the shore to your left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They broke into a run and reached the house before
Cap’n Belah and his “kerridge” arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have the key to the back door,” announced
Mabel; “we’ll go in that way.” This they did, and
at once entered a small passage which led on one side
into the kitchen and on the other to the maid’s room.
Mabel surveyed the two rooms speculatively. “I pray
they may be big enough for Beulah,” she remarked.
Then there came a pounding at the front door, and
they went on through the living-room to admit Cap’n
Belah’s load.</p>

    <div>THE HAUNTED HOUSE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>An intensely blue sea embracing green islands, gray
rocks against which sometimes curled, sometimes
dashed, white-crested waves; a sky softly blue in the
daytime, often rosy-flecked at sunset, at night a splendid
background for myriad stars which never before
seemed so near and so bright; peaked fir trees, song
sparrows singing from the housetops, robins calling
cheerfully from grassy hummocks, all these so impressed
Ellen that it was with difficulty that she could
bring herself to make a practical application of her
mind to such affairs as her cousin demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>The house, though small, gave ample room for even
Beulah. It was still cool enough in the evenings to
light the logs in the big fireplace, and the days were
long enough to afford time for walks in the morning,
sailing in the afternoon, and supper on the rocks before
dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy was in her element in the exercise of
her executive powers, and Beulah burst forth into
song at intervals, thus showing her content with the
situation.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, the latter met her Waterloo the first time
that lobsters were to be served for supper. She appeared
at the door of the living-room gingerly holding
a lobster in each hand, gripping a claw firmly with
a dish towel. “Law, Miss Rindy,” she exclaimed,
“what kin’ o’ bugs is dese? I skeered o’ ’em. Boy
fetch ’em in an’ say yuh-alls order ’em. What good
is dey, Miss Rindy, ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, good to eat,” answered Miss Rindy. “Did
you never see a lobster, Beulah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hears Miss Mabel talk ’bout live br’iled lobster.
Is dey daid?” Beulah regarded them suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course. I wouldn’t undertake, myself, to boil
them, so I had Mrs. Simpson do it for us; it is an
everyday matter with her. You’ve heard the saying,
‘red as a boiled lobster,’ haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ’specs I has, but I doesn’t recomember. Anyway,
Miss Rindy, yuh doesn’t ketch me eatin’ dem evil-eyed
critturs. How yuh eats ’em? Dey is hard as rocks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You open them as you do crabs, and take out the
meat,” Miss Rindy explained. “You’ve prepared
crabs many a time, Beulah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yas’m, I has, but I skeered to tackle dese
owdacious-lookin’ critturs. I knows crabs, but I nuver
had de presentations of dese yere lobsters.” She bore
them back to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now what’s to be done?” said Miss Rindy. “Do
you know anything about opening lobsters, Miss Wickham?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I don’t. It has never been a part of
my education.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor mine. I don’t want you all to be poisoned
by getting hold of some deadly part,” returned Miss
Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not take them up to Mrs. Simpson and get
her to show us how?” Ellen suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just the ticket,” exclaimed Mabel, springing up.
“Come along, Ellen. We’ll take a lesson from Mrs.
Belah, and the next time we’ll show Beulah, so we’ll
be independent for the rest of the summer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They bundled up the lobsters and bore them off to
Mrs. Simpson, who laughed when she learned their
errand. That any one should be so ignorant as not
to know how to open lobsters was incomprehensible to
her. “These city folks don’t know everything,” she
confided to her next-door neighbor. However, she
was “pleased to accommodate them,” she said, and
each girl performed her task creditably under direction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Belah, or Aunt Noby, as every one called her,
was a gentle old lady who had not outgrown an ancient
belief in witches, signs, charms, and ghosts. She
had had signs that very morning which indicated that
she was to have strange visitors, so she was not in the
least surprised when the two girls arrived. There was
a horseshoe nailed above the door to keep off witches,
for “there do be witches,” she said. As for ghosts,
was there not a haunted house on the very next island?
Every one knew that mysterious noises issued from
it at certain times, and more than one had heard footsteps
and had actually seen a pale face at the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How fascinating!” cried Mabel. “We must go
over there and investigate some day, Ellen. Have you
ever been there, Aunt Noby?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not I. Nothing would induce me. I’ve no wish
to have any dealings with ungodly beings. The Bible
warns us. Wasn’t Saul made to suffer because he
dealt with familiar spirits? No, no, I cast all such
doings from me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls took their leave, smiling as they went.
“Isn’t she a dear, old-fashioned thing?” said Mabel.
“Just the same, I mean to explore that house. Will
you be a sport and go with me, Ellen? It will be
such an adventure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing would suit me better. I’m primed for
high adventure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let’s go this afternoon; there’s no time like
the present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The matter of lobsters was forgotten in this new
excitement, but Miss Rindy brought back the subject,
and the two girls were obliged to explain the anatomy
of the creature before they were permitted to talk
of anything else.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One thing at a time,” said Miss Rindy. “I have
a single-track mind, and can’t mix lobsters with
haunted houses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will go with us, won’t you? Please,” Ellen
begged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How far is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Over on the next island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too far for an old limp-and-go-fetch-it like me.
Don’t stay too late, and don’t let the goblins get you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls started off in high feather. Their way
led to the end of Beatty’s Island, and thence by means
of a bridge to Minor’s Island. Wild roses adorned the
sides of the road, little ripe strawberries peeped out
from the running tendrils of their vines, a sandpiper
twittered and ran along ahead of them in frightened
endeavor to lead them away from its nest, gulls
screamed in noisy combat as they followed in the wake
of a fishing boat, but the girls heeded none of these,
for their spirits were winged for adventure.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Mabel’s companionship Ellen felt happier than
she had been since the dear studio days. On this
peaceful island all the troubles of the past three years
seemed to roll from her; the present was enough, no
need to peer into the shadowy future. “Ah me, how
glorious all this is!” she sighed contentedly. “I wonder
if you know, Mabel Wickham, what it means to
me to have you to walk with, to talk to. Never have
I had such a dear chummy person to delight my soul.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Same here,” replied Mabel promptly. “All my
life I’ve been looking for an Ellen North, and to think
I should have found her simply by putting my finger
on a little spot on the map. Don’t tell me things just
happen; they are ordered, arranged by Heaven, or
they wouldn’t be so wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I believe. Do you suppose there are any more
delightful things waiting for us around the corner?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or at the haunted house,” returned Mabel laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That might be, of course. No place is so queer
or so insignificant that it cannot hold the germ of a
future joy, Mr. Todd says.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a dear old man he is. I’d like just such a
friend, but they don’t seem to come my way. You are
a lucky girl, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe I am in some directions. Certainly I
have some wonderful friends, you, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks for the compliment; I can return it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think you would have the opportunity of
making any kind of friend you wished,” said Ellen
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t know how difficult it is. I scarcely
ever meet any one who thinks my thoughts or likes my
likes. If I do meet any one promising, he or she is
whisked away before I have a chance for a better
acquaintance. Of course I do know some perfectly
dear people that I love dearly, but they can’t enter into
my interests and ambitions. My dear grandmother
thinks I am queer to want a career. She can’t see
why I shouldn’t be satisfied with a butterfly existence.
I live within sight of the Monument, which is a fact
that settles my status, to her mind. I can sit at my
window and watch the passers-by as they promenade
after church, a great privilege, that. I can listen to
all the latest gossip about those in my own set. I can
go to the best shops and have intimate talks with Miss
Maggie or Miss Jennie, who will advise me what to
buy, and will serve me well because I am my grandmother’s
granddaughter. I never have to soil my
hands with menial work. I can entertain and be
entertained, so what in the world is there left in life
to wish for?” Mabel laughed a little bitterly. “Would
that fill your life satisfactorily?” she asked earnestly.
“Would clothes and fine food and foolish gossip make
up the summum bonum of your existence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I am sure it wouldn’t, although I haven’t any
large contempt for the fine clothes and food. I shall
not disdain that lobster salad, for example.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel laughed. “But you have your career all cut
out for you, a talent to cultivate which is a gift the
fairies did not bestow upon me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know you haven’t a talent? What
career appeals to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something that would be for the good of mankind.
I’d like to go into social service, but Gran would
be horrified, be scared lest I should lower my position
in life by washing the faces of dirty little children. I
might bring home germs, or some one might see me
speaking to one of the lower classes; that would never
do. I have thought of teaching, training for some
special subject, but it would mean that I might rob
one more deserving of a salary. I don’t want to be a
secretary, nor do I want to go into business. Those
who need to make a living should not be thrust aside
by those whose living is assured; that is what destroys
the balance. So, there you are, Ellen. What shall
I do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know but your vocation may be that
of home-maker?” returned Ellen laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bah! I didn’t expect that of you, Ellen. I see
no prospect of such a career at present. I am twenty
years old, and it is time I was turning my attention to
something definite. It is all very well for you to talk,
who know exactly what you are going to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What am I going to do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cultivate your musical talents, your lovely voice
and all that. Go to the city and study, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And desert Cousin Rindy? Oh, no, I couldn’t do
that. I shall stand by in Marshville as long as she
needs me. When she doesn’t, I’ll begin to think of
something else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you wouldn’t have to desert her; she could go
to the city with you and take a little apartment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think we are bloated bond-holders? No,
no, Marshville must be my home as long as it is Cousin
Rindy’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel looked troubled, but had no answer just then,
for the haunted house was before them. It was a
dingy, ramshackle building, gray and deserted; broken
slats flapped in the shutters, doors sagged on their
hinges, and one dead limb of a scraggy tree scraped
the moss-grown roof at every gust of wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two girls, however, did not hesitate to approach
by way of a grass-grown walk. “It does look the
character,” observed Mabel as they paused on the
sunken door-step, “yet it must have been rather a nice
old place in its day. Shall we go in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? The hants won’t be waiting for us
outside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They won’t be inside either, unless I miss my
guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what we came ‘for to see.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>The sagging front door did not yield to their efforts
to open it. “Probably is nailed up,” suggested Mabel.
“Let’s go around to the back.” This they did, and
found an entrance through a low door, which led into
a shed, which, in turn, opened into a large kitchen
where a battered stove and some broken chairs stood.
“It’s evident that no one has lived here for a long
time,” remarked Mabel, looking around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one but spiders,” returned Ellen, looking up at
the cobwebs which draped the corners of the room.
“Let’s go on, Mabel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They went from room to room, finding only a few
bits of old furniture, and hearing only the tap-tap of
the gaunt branch upon the roof, the creak of broken
shutters, and the whir of wings in the chimney.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Swallows,” exclaimed Ellen, “chimney-swifts they
call them. Maybe they are the ghosts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel opened a door which disclosed a flight of
steps leading to the attic, but she closed it quickly.
“Don’t go up,” she cried, as something came swooping
toward her. “The house has bats in its belfry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed and turned toward a cupboard whose
door she opened. “A discovery! A discovery!” she
cried. “Come here, Mabel. See what I’ve found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel hurried over to the corner where Ellen stood
examining something she held in her hand. “What
is it? What is it?” Mabel inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A card with a name and a date. Some one has
been here this year before us. See.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel took the card and read, “Compliments to the
ghost.” Then followed the initials R. M., the date,
and the engraved name Robert MacDonald. “What
a lark!” she exclaimed. “I wonder who Robert is.
He has an imagination, whoever he may be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s write something on the back of the card and
leave it,” suggested Ellen. “We’ll come back some
day and see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Done,” agreed Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>After consultation they decided to write: “Thanks
for compliments. With hopes for a better acquaintance,
The Ghost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will whet Robert’s curiosity if he ever comes
here again,” declared Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it is a sort of adventure for us,” responded
Ellen. “I rather hope he will come again, don’t you,
Mabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, for it will be sort of exciting for us to follow
up the affair. We must make it as mysterious as possible,
and never, never let on that we have anything to
do with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They laid the card back on the dusty shelf and left
the gloomy house, laughing and excited in the possession
of a secret.</p>

<p class='c009'>The summer cottages were beginning to fill up,
guests were arriving at the boarding-houses, consequently
there was always a crowd at the post-office
when the mail was sorted. The steamboat which
brought it had just steamed off when the girls reached
the long flight of steps which led to the wharf. They
threaded their way through the crowd which was
thronging the small store. Most took advantage of
the hour to do their marketing, since fresh supplies
generally came on the boat, so the boxes and crates
received attention until it was time for the little post-office
window to be opened.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen and Mabel took their places in line. A young
man, looking over his shoulder, stepped aside. “Take
my place,” he said; “I’m not in a hurry.” He raised
his hat and walked off while they moved up, and presently,
loaded up with letters, papers, two bottles of
milk, and a box of strawberries, they started for home.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was a nice, polite somebody,” remarked
Mabel; “I wonder who he is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Robert MacDonald maybe,” returned Ellen laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t it be funny if he were? I suppose we
could find out. Would you ask?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, don’t; it would spoil our secret. Let’s
keep up the mystery for a while longer. If it should
be he, we would feel sort of conscious; and if it isn’t,
there is no harm done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I reckon you’re right. I rather like his looks,
whatever his name may be. We’ll leave it this way:
if we meet him around, we’ll probably find out all
about him. If he should prove to be Robert, we can
keep our own counsel and he will have no way of
identifying us, so there you are. There may nothing
more come of it, for it is quite likely that he will never
pay another visit to the haunted house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall be really disappointed if he doesn’t. It
would be such fun if he were to answer our message.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wouldn’t count on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I shall try to restrain my curiosity for a
week, but no longer. A week from to-day I go again.
What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say we don’t set any time, but just leave the
whole thing to chance. We’ll go again when it’s convenient,
whether it be to-morrow, next week, or the
week after. It is more fun to have it chancy like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen agreed that it would be so, and they went on
to deliver their supplies to Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We brought a box of strawberries, but there
wasn’t any cream to-day. Mr. Nevins says it must
have been put off on one of the other islands,” Ellen
explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear me!” exclaimed Miss Rindy. “That’s just
the way it goes. Yesterday they lost our mackerel out
of the wagon and some one picked it up on the road,
and to-day this happens. Well, we can have strawberry
shortcake for supper, and as soon as I can get
around to it I’ll go up to Portland and lay in a lot
of supplies, things that can’t be had here. It is rather
disconcerting, but I’ve been up against worse situations
over in France.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it’s rather fun not to know exactly what
you are going to have, something like a game in which
you don’t know just how you will come out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s one way to look at it,” returned Miss
Rindy. “Suppose you turn to and hull these strawberries
while Beulah is making the shortcake; then I
can attend to the rest of the supper. Did you have a
good walk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fine,” Ellen answered, but she said no word of
the haunted house.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

    <div>THE BRIDGE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But a week was not allowed to elapse before the
two girls saw an opportunity of crossing the
bridge again to make a second visit to the haunted
house. Miss Rindy one evening declared her intention
of spending the next day in Portland. She had
now almost recovered from her accident, and with the
aid of her stick could get about perfectly with scarce
a sign of a limp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beulah will look after you,” she told the two girls.
“She knows what to do, and if anything goes wrong,
you, Ellen, can set it right. It won’t hurt you to take
a little responsibility once in a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems to me that I have proved that I can,” retorted
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, perhaps you have, in a measure, but that
was at home; it is different here. One should be prepared
to meet any emergency, no matter where.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen shrugged her shoulders. Why couldn’t Cousin
Rindy give her the credit for having rather good judgment?
However, she said nothing, but speeded her on
her way, and then returned to Mabel, who had not
risen for so early a breakfast as was necessary for
Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a lazybones I am,” said Mabel as she came
down to find Miss Rindy gone and Ellen finished with
her breakfast. “Gran always indulged me, so that if
I wanted to linger in bed she never said a word. I
am afraid I am not sufficiently grateful to Gran, but
I don’t know that girls usually possess that virtue.
We take what is done for us as a matter of course,
expect it as our right. You are the only truly grateful
young person I know, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I? You don’t know me. I feel mighty sassy
sometimes, and express my opinions accordingly,
though I try never to forget what Cousin Rindy has
done for me. If she were a really, truly parent, I
might feel different, but as it is I consider that I would
be a disgraceful ingrate if I lost sight of my benefits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lots of girls wouldn’t be so particular. It isn’t
the modern fashion to show respect to your elders. I
know girls who call down their parents as if they
were the children and the girls were the parents. Oh,
yes; boys, too, generally think they know it all. They
call any one of a past generation a back number, non-progressive,
and all that. I don’t quite agree with
Gran when she says: ‘Young people think old people
are fools; old people know young ones are;’ that always
makes me mad, chiefly, I suppose, because it is
said at a time when I want my own way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do suppose we should allow some value to experience,”
replied Ellen thoughtfully. “How will you
have your eggs, Mabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you dear thing, are you attending to my breakfast?
You have made fresh coffee and toast, too.
Where is Beulah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is attending to things up-stairs. You know I
don’t mind doing such things for you, Mabel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Consider yourself kissed for that speech. The
eggs? Oh, yes, suppose you scramble them; you always
do them so beautifully that way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bouquet for me in return for mine,” said Ellen
laughing, as she went out to the kitchen. “What are
we going to do with ourselves to-day?” she asked as
she came back with the eggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, let me see. Oh, Ellen, why isn’t this just
our chance to go to the haunted house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course; you’ve said it, child. By the way,
have you heard that the polite young man of the post-office
incident is not Robert MacDonald? He and some
others are camping on a neighboring island. He just
happened to be here that day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who told you all that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cap’n Belah; you know he keeps wind of everything
that goes on. I met him on my way from the
boat this morning after seeing Cousin Rindy off, and
he asked me facetiously why I wasn’t keeping my
weather eye out for ‘them boys over on Halsey’s
Island, likely-lookin’ chaps.’ ‘What boys?’ I asked.
‘Do you know their names?’ Wal, he cal’lated that
he couldn’t name ’em all, but the one that came over
oftenest for supplies went by name of Tom Clayton.
They cruised around consid’rable in a motor-boat,
there was something like half a dozen of ’em, and they
had h’isted tents, was kind of soldiering, he cal’lated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel laughed at Ellen’s imitation. “Well, you
have done well in gathering in your sheaves so early
in the morning. Anything more?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I asked if one was named Robert MacDonald. I
couldn’t resist that question, Mabel. But Cap’n Belah
‘disremembered,’ so I didn’t gain anything by ‘satiable
curiosity.’ Shall we go this morning or this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This afternoon, I think, for I must write some
letters this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Same here, as Clyde says. I must write to Caro
or she will feel neglected. I wish the dear child
wouldn’t be so jealous of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jealousy is a mean trait, on a par with ingratitude.
One is caused by an inflated ego, the other by
a thoughtless one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you learn so much?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Read it in a book.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Book spoke the truth. To be jealous one must
consider one’s self worthy of first place, of satisfying
every side of the other’s nature, and possessing so
many excellent traits that nobody else could stand the
same chance in another’s affections.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Spoken like a very oracle. Wise little noddle,
yours is, Ellen. You think real big thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve had plenty of time for such, and have not
lived in the frivolous atmosphere that some others
have,” returned Ellen saucily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out upon your frivolous atmosphere! Am I not
doing all I can to escape from it? I see where I shall
become a perfect prig if I allow myself to indulge in
such moralizing. Away with priggishness, jealousy,
and all such stuff. To-day is ours for romance!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes, romance!” echoed Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>They made an early start that afternoon, for it
may be said that Mabel was just as curious as Ellen.
The air blew fresh from the sea, so that they did not
need to loiter by the way because of undue heat. They
reached the house without adventure. All was as
silent, as depressing, as before, but this time the two
did not stop to explore, but made straight for the
cupboard, which Ellen reached first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s gone!” she cried. “The card is gone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel peered over her friend’s shoulder at the
empty shelf, but presently she looked down to spy
something lying on the floor. She swooped down
upon it and held a scrap of paper high over her head.
“Look! Look!” she exclaimed. “It blew down
when we opened the cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They raced to the nearest window, the better to see
what was written. Mabel read aloud:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Greetings to thee, ghost, or shall we say ghostess?
For I much suspect thee to be the latter, and not a
disembodied spirit, elusive though thou art. Wilt thou
not materialize and appear in the flesh to</p>

<div class='c014'>“R. M.”</div>

<p class='c012'>“Isn’t it perfectly lovely?” cried Ellen excitedly.
“Do let’s answer it. Of course we must not divulge
our identity, but we can answer. O dear! I haven’t
a bit of paper, though I do happen to have a pencil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s look around; perhaps we can find something
that will do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good idea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel began her search, looking in every room, but
for some reason every scrap of paper had been disposed
of in some way. “Used to kindle a fire,” Ellen
surmised. “I’ll look around out of doors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She went out, but rollicking winds had borne away
anything like paper, supposing any had ever lodged
there. But presently a brilliant idea struck her as she
caught sight of a couple of logs lying in an outhouse,
too heavy, perhaps, to be confiscated by any boys who
might have played there. From one of these logs Ellen
stripped a piece of birch bark, the inner side of
which was smooth and clean. She bore it indoors in
triumph. “See what I found,” she said as she extended
her prize. “We can write on it as the Indians
do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Injun,” said Mabel. “What are you going
to write? I’m out of this because it’s your find.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen demurred, but Mabel was firm, and finally
Ellen wrote:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good day to you, fair sir! Seek not to penetrate
the mysteries. Desire not the unattainable. Flesh
may meet flesh, but spirit cannot behold spirit unless
drawn by some heavenly means.</p>

<div class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>The Ghost.</span>”</div>

<p class='c012'>She read it to Mabel, who immediately gave praise.
“It’s fine,” she declared; “so delightfully mystifying
and obscure. I’ll venture to say that Robert will be
devoured with curiosity and won’t waste any time in
answering.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t it be fatal if some one else should find
it?” said Ellen. “I hope no one will. We’d better
get away for fear somebody might be lurking in ambush.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They deposited the message on the shelf and hurried
off, giggling and self-conscious, but making up
their minds that their correspondent must be one of
the campers on Halsey’s Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>A week slipped away before the girls found another
chance to cross the bridge. The little neck of land
upon which the old house stood contained no other
dwelling, and it was seldom visited by the natives,
who shunned it because of its uncanny reputation,
while the summer residents found more beautiful
spots to attract them. Beatty’s Island was now quite
full of visitors, the cottages all open, the boarding-houses
crowded. Groups of watchers perched on the
rocks, never weary of looking at the waves rolling in.
The road was no longer a lonely one. The dispensers
of ice-cream and delectable drinks were kept busy in
the Little Gray Shop, while the delivery trucks dashed
up and down the road at a threatening rate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls had made a number of acquaintances and
were much in demand. Picnics, suppers on the rocks,
motor-boat parties to some farther island where shore
dinners were a feature, informal teas at the cottage
of some neighbor, all these took up their time. Ellen
was appealed to when her musical ability became
known, and every Sunday she took her place at the
small organ in the little church.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in all this time they had not come to know
either Robert MacDonald or Tom Clayton. Sometimes
as they skimmed past Halsey’s Island in a motor-boat
they caught sight of a group of young men busied
at some employment outside the tents, or hoisting the
sails of a small boat which rode at anchor near by.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems as if our secret would forever remain a
secret,” remarked Mabel as the two neared their destination
one August afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is much more romantic the way it is. We might
be frightfully disappointed in Robert if we were to
meet him. I don’t know that I really want to. Do
you?” Ellen asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not sure. It would be rather fun to see him
without his knowing who we are; then we could decide
whether we wanted to continue this funny correspondence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe we could manage that, though there may
be no answer to our last effusion. Let’s hurry up and
find out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But when they reached the room and opened the
cupboard door there was another note which they eagerly
read. It ran:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hail to thee, blythe spirit! A wood-nymph thou
art, I know now by thy birch-bark sign. The hollow
tree must be thy dwelling place. Mortal though I be,
I fain would have speech with thee. Can I not lure
thee forth by some subtle strain? Music is a language
common to all. When and how can we meet?</p>

<div class='c014'>“R. M.”</div>

<p class='c012'>The girls sat down on the worn steps which led up-stairs,
and began to confer upon a plan of procedure.
First one and then the other made suggestions, whispering
and glancing up once in a while, as if they
feared discovery. At last, amid much laughter, they
decided upon a plot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s lucky I brought paper this time,” said Mabel,
producing a small pad, “unless you’d rather continue
the birch-bark episode.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, now that we have come down to practical
facts, let’s have the paper, and you write this time;
that will make it the more confusing, although I disguised
my writing,—printed the words; it was easier
to do it on the birch bark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They left the note in the usual place and went off
chuckling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have to tell Cousin Rindy,” said Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a lot of others,” returned Mabel. “That’s a
picturesque old house, Ellen; it’s a pity some one
doesn’t buy it and fix it up. The stable and hen-house
are in pretty good order; if the house were painted and
had a new roof, it could be made a pretty place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ghost would have to be exorcised before any
one would undertake to do the repairs,” Ellen answered.
“It would be a fine place for an artist; the
stable could be turned into a studio, and think what
a view there is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True. I might buy it, but Gran would be scandalized
if I turned it into a studio for an artist; she
thinks they are a godless lot, and musicians are not far
behind. She doesn’t half approve of my visits to
Aunt Nell and her unconventional friends. She thinks
Aunt Nell is old enough to discriminate, but I am a
mere infant who should be safeguarded against the
wiles of that wild Bohemian set, as she calls them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “Respectable Bohemia is one of the
loveliest places in the world, but there is a set that goes
to the limit, I must confess, though I don’t think
even that is any worse than the fast set in the social
world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t I know that? It is because of what I have
seen in that fast set that I am sick of society in general,
and want to get out into something better. I
never saw any drinking, gambling, or immoral doings
among Aunt Nell’s artist friends. Think of dear,
good Mr. Barstow, the Austins, and your own parents,
all such sincere, high-minded, single-hearted people.
It is among such that I want to cast my lot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me, too,” responded Ellen cordially. And here the
talk ended.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as they returned they poured forth the tale
of their adventure. Miss Rindy listened attentively,
but with disapproval written on her face. “You don’t
mean to say that you two have been carrying on with a
strange man,” she reproved when the tale was done.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it hasn’t gone very far,” answered Mabel
cheerfully; “and the creature wouldn’t know us from
a side of sole leather if he were to meet us in broad
daylight. We know him as one Robert MacDonald,
but he hasn’t the faintest idea who we are. Naturally
we are wild to see what he looks like, and we have
evolved a scheme which we want you to help us carry
out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You want me?” Miss Rindy looked shocked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, please, ma’am,” said Ellen meekly. “When
you learn our plan I am sure you won’t object, and
that you’ll fall into it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no intention of falling into disgrace at my
age,” replied Miss Rindy tartly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both girls laughed. “Softly, softly, my good lady,”
cried Mabel. “Just you listen to our scheme before
you get wrathy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t kick before you’re spurred, as you sometimes
say to me,” Ellen joined in. “We’ve shown
you the correspondence up to date, all except the note
which we left in the cupboard to-day. Can you remember
what you wrote, Mabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so. It was something like this. ‘I will
meet you on the middle of the bridge on Friday afternoon
at four o’clock. I will wear a white dress with
a bunch of goldenrod in my belt, so you may know
me.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you mean to do this bold thing?” Miss
Rindy was still indignant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, we mean to do it, and we expect at least a
dozen to do the same thing, you among the number.
In so doing we shall see what our young man looks
like, while he won’t have the faintest idea which of
the dozen is his correspondent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Miss Rindy threw back her head and laughed.
“Clever, clever girls,” she cried. “Of course I’ll join
the gang. I wouldn’t miss the fun of seeing that
young man’s expression for anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must go on the war-path this very afternoon,”
decided Mabel, “for we want to see how many we can
muster in; the more the merrier.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This they did, and came back with the report that
at least twenty had promised to join them, so that
when the afternoon came the little company was ready
for the march. It was a varied assortment of sizes,
ages, and styles. All wore white hats, which covered
their hair, and sprays of goldenrod stuck in their belts.
On the stroke of four they advanced in a body to the
middle of the bridge where they were met, not by a
single individual, but by as many as six young men,
who passed them nonchalantly, while one of them
casually remarked, “Must be going on a picnic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“More like the chorus from the opera of ‘Patience,’”
observed another as he softly sang, “Twenty love-sick
maidens we.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The twenty moved on, stifling their laughter as best
they could. “And we don’t know a man Jack among
them,” whispered Mabel to Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And probably they don’t know a woman Jenny
among us,” returned Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>The twenty pursued their way a little farther and
then climbed down the rocks to where a motor-boat
was awaiting them. Into this they entered and were
borne away, leaving the young men to their own devices.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was Miss Rindy’s idea. “I wasn’t going to
have even the single one we expected to meet, tagging
after us to see where we lived, any one of us,” she said.</p>

    <div>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was only a day or two after this that Ellen, going
for the mail, met Cap’n Belah on the road. He
grinned when he saw her. “Wal, I hear you women
folks met up with your match the other afternoon,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you might call it a drawn game,” Ellen
retorted; “neither party got the better of the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was a right cute trick of you folks, going
and coming in a motor-bo-at so they couldn’t get their
bearings,” the cap’n went on. “If they’d hove to in
their own craft, you couldn’t have got away so spry.
I snum I never see a bo-at go slicker than she does,
slips through the water like a fish; howsomever, you
got the best of the boys that time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was Cousin Rindy’s idea. She couldn’t walk so
far, and the boat made it the easiest way to get to the
bridge with the whole party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So ’twas. Wal, you won’t have to try any more
tricks. I’d know as you’ve heard that the boys has
sailed for another port, picked up stakes and left Halsey’s,
lugged away all their dunnage, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen hadn’t heard, but she did not betray her ignorance,
only asking, “When did they leave?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Struck their tents and sot sail early this morning,
cal’lated they might come back another year, but, land!
you can’t count on young folks. Step in and have a
word with my woman, can’t ye?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ellen had no notion of stopping, eager as she
was to carry home her news. Mabel saw her coming
and met her on the porch. “I have a sad, sad piece
of information for you,” Ellen exclaimed. “We shall
never have the bliss of meeting Robert MacDonald.
He and all his comrades have left for parts unknown.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really?” Mabel looked her surprise. “Do you
suppose they were so chagrined at the success of our
little manœuvre that they couldn’t stand the jeers of
the populace? We did get the best of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was diamond cut diamond, it seems to me.
Well, that episode is finished. It was fun while it
lasted, but it reminds me of some of these modern
stories that leave you hanging up in the air. Adieu,
Robert!” She kissed her hand in the direction of
Halsey’s Island, and the two went in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know that at last I have persuaded Miss
Rindy to go off on a spree with me?” said Mabel as
she began to open her mail. “We’re going up to
Portland for the day. You know I’ve been begging
her all summer, and at last she is going, just to get
rid of my teasing, she says. We’re going to ride all
over town, do a little shopping, have lunch at that
nice hotel, in the dining-room at the top where you
get such a lovely view, and then we’ll go to a movie.
Isn’t the prospect sufficiently alluring to tempt you to
join us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave this lovely island just to spend the day in
a city? No, thank you, ma’am. Moreover, two is
company; three is a crowd. You two will have a much
better time without me, and it will be exciting to see
what you bring home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I accept your point of view, but don’t say you
were not invited.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the matter was settled to Ellen’s satisfaction, and
the next morning saw her two housemates off for what
Mabel was pleased to call their “spree.” Ellen busied
herself about the house for an hour, then she went
down to the rocks with her writing materials, accomplished
a letter to Caro, and one to Jeremy Todd; then
Beulah called her to dinner, so the morning went.
Beulah, it may be said, had made the acquaintance of
several maids of like color, and enjoyed with them
hilarious laughter, mirthful pokes and digs when some
appreciated joke was made, and feasts either on the
rocks or off in the woods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me an’ some other colored ladies is plannin’ to
have a little fessible in de woods dis afternoon,” she
confided to Ellen. “Miss Rindy, she say she don’t
min’. I be back in time to git supper. Yuh don’t
keer, does yuh, Miss Ellen, if I leaves yuh to yo’ own
wicked revices?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “I don’t mind in the least, so long
as you’re back in time to get supper. If I’m not here,
you know where to find the key.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We goin’ have a gran’ feas’,” Beulah gave further
information; “ice-cream an’ bananas, an’ peanuts and
half a watermillion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take care you don’t make yourself ill,” Ellen
warned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Law, Miss Ellen, it tek mo’n dem little things to
discommoderate mah stummick. Miss Rindy say we
has lobsters fo’ supper, an’ I sho’ wants room fo’ dem.
I sutt’nly does decline to lobsters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you’d better decline them altogether after
all that other mess,” responded Ellen, who was busy
formulating her own plans for the afternoon. She had
just conceived the idea of paying a parting visit to the
haunted house. It was barely possible, she considered,
that a farewell message had been left by the unknown
Robert. It would do no harm to see.</p>

<p class='c009'>She set off on her walk, making her way leisurely
along the shore, deciding that it would be the more
interesting route when one was alone. She stopped
to look in the little pools where starfish, sea-urchins,
and various other sea creatures made their abode.
From a pebbly beach she picked up two or three talisman
stones, gray, banded about by a dark streak.
Here, too, seaweeds, brilliant green and feathery, pink
or yellow, attracted her. “Mabel and I must come
here and gather some,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaving the beach, she climbed the rocks, cut across
a field, and reached the road which led to the bridge.
There was no one in sight when she came up to the
haunted house, which she entered in the usual way,
by means of a back door. She tiptoed across the big
room and opened the cupboard by the side of the great
fireplace, but before she could look to see if anything
was there she started back, for the strains of a violin
came clearly to her ears. She looked wildly around
for a way of escape, for the music was coming nearer
and nearer. It was just outside! It was at the door!
Ellen rushed toward the stairway, and had just set
foot on the first step when a voice said: “Don’t run
away. I am perfectly harmless.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned to face an entirely strange young man.
For at least ten seconds the two stood and looked at
each other; then the young man rushed forward, holding
out his hand. “It is Cronette! Of course it is.
I forgot, you may not be able to recognize me, but
you will recognize your old friend violin.” He held
it out to her and she took it mechanically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are—you are——” she stammered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reed Marshall, your old friend, Cronine. Naturally
you don’t remember my looks, but you haven’t
forgotten me, have you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no; oh, no,” Ellen recovered herself. “How
could I forget you? But I never really knew what you
looked like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I couldn’t forget what you looked like, once
having seen you. Isn’t this the greatest luck? Let’s
sit down and tell each other the story of our lives.
How do you happen to be ’way down East? I am
that glad to see you that I could dash over to the
Amen corner and shout Glory! Where are you staying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Over on Beatty’s Island with Miss Wickham.
She has a cottage there, and Cousin Rindy and I are
spending the summer with her. Where are you staying?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, right here. I came up with a crowd of fellows
to camp out on a little island off here. The rest
of the bunch had to leave, but Tom Clayton and I
skirmished around to find a spot where we could bunk.
We are both daffy about this coast, and want to do
some sketching. We happened on this old place, which
we are able to get for a mere song. The house threatened
leaks and hants and sich, so we decided it would
be more cozy if we fixed up the stable, hen-house, or
whatever it is called. We have begged, borrowed,
stolen, and bought sundry and varisome things to make
us comfortable, and we’re going to stay on till the
ghost gets too much for us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Ellen. “It is all quite wonderful,
isn’t it?” She was still bewildered at the turn of
events.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say it is, but most wonderful of all is this
running across you. By the way, Cronette, what
brought you over here? Very few ever come around
this way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The color flamed up into Ellen’s face as she stammered,
“I—I—just was curious to—to—see——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ghost? You don’t believe in ghos’es, do
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen’s face was still flaming. “I—yes—no—I
don’t know,” she answered in confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed regarded her steadfastly for a moment; then
he said, “Cronette, honest Injun, can it be possible
that you are my wood-nymph?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your wood-nymph?” she spoke in surprise.
“Why, that was Robert MacDonald,” and then again
the color surged up into her face as she realized that
she had said too much.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Reed’s turn to look surprised. “Robert
MacDonald? Who is the bird? Oh, I say, Cronette,
what’s the use of beating about the bush? Tell your
uncle all about it and I’ll ’fess up, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen hesitated, but at further urging she said:
“We, Mabel and I, came over to see the haunted
house. We found a card, Mr. Robert MacDonald’s
card. On it was written ‘Compliments to the ghost,’
and so we drew our own conclusions. We thought
it would be a lark to answer it, which we did. Perhaps
you know the rest, and can tell me who is Robert
MacDonald.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed looked puzzled for a moment, then he struck
his forehead tragically. “Dolt that I am!” he exclaimed.
“I see it now. I didn’t happen to have a
card of my own that first time I visited this mansion,
so I took one that I happened to have in my pocket,
one that a fellow gave me some time ago. I actually
had forgotten his name, and had no intention of forging
his initials when I signed my own, which are the
same, you see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we shall never meet Robert,” rejoined Ellen
half regretfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed laughed. “Are you then so disappointed?
I’m pleased to pieces myself. To think that you should
be my wood-nymph is the jolliest sort of a surprise,
and we’ll keep it a secret all to ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can we keep it a secret when all those men
know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What men?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All those you were with on Halsey’s Island, and
that met us in a body on the bridge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed threw back his head and shouted. “That’s
one on you, Cronette, for I didn’t tell them a thing
except that I had a date with a female person whom
I didn’t know, and until I saw her I thought we’d
better march in company. Well, you know how it
came out, and if the boys didn’t jolly me well, you
miss your guess. That was some blind game, Cronette,
and I must acknowledge myself the loser. In
all that horde of white-robed, goldenrod-decked females
I never looked for you; even your hair didn’t
show under that hat. By the way, now is my chance
to get a sketch of you, the chance I missed last winter.
May I make it? We’re old friends, you know. You’ll
let me come over to see you, won’t you, and may I
bring Tom along? He’s an all-right fellow, lots of
talent and a great pal of mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen gave her consent. She had liked Tom’s looks,
and recalled his little act of courtesy in the post-office.
She told Reed about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just like Tom,” he responded. “He’s always
looking out for the other fellow. At this very moment
he is off helping his cousin to establish herself
at Beatty’s. She has taken a cottage there for a
month. Nice little woman she is; you’ll like her.
Queer, Cronette, but it seems as if I had known you
all my life, although this is really only the second time
we have met.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen considered this for a moment before she said,
“Probably it is because we both know Don Pedro so
well, and then you know the violin is a common bond.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s quite as if I had adopted a member of your
family, isn’t it? No end of comfort it is, too,—quite
like a brother. You know the song, ‘Fiddle and I’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it and love it. I am very glad you have
the violin,” she said after a moment’s silence. “It
was very generous of you to buy it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no, it wasn’t; I wanted it in the worst way.
Would you like to hear it again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He picked it up and held it lovingly as he played
several short bits. While not a finished performer he
played with some skill and much feeling, and so absorbed
were both in the performance that neither noticed
the time till suddenly the boat whistled at the
landing next to Beatty’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen started up. “Goodness!” she exclaimed.
“The boat will be here in another minute or so, and
I must run for it. I promised to meet my friends
and help with their parcels.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go with you,” Reed stated. “I must lock up
this treasure first, but I won’t be a minute. Don’t
wait; I’ll catch up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen started at a swift pace, but Reed’s long legs
bore him to her side before the bridge was reached.
The boat was turning a point in sight, and the whistle
for Beatty’s blew before they arrived at the long flight
of steps. Down these they raced, arriving at the wharf
just as the boat’s gangplank was lowered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy and Mabel came ashore, laden with
bundles, some of which Ellen took possession of.
“You’re all out of breath,” Miss Rindy commented,
“and your face is as red as a beet. What have you
been doing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Running for the boat. We were late getting here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We? What we?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Marshall and I.” Ellen turned to present
Reed, who loaded himself with bundles in spite of
Miss Rindy’s protests.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s a fellow good for if he can’t be useful
once in a while?” he replied, smiling. “Hello! there’s
old Tom; I’ll press him into service. Any more dunnage,
Miss Crump?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a box somewhere, but that can be sent
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No need when here are two donkeys to carry it.
Come here, Tom,” he shouted as his friend was walking
off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Introductions were made in short order, and then
the party turned toward home. “Shall we wait for
the mail?” asked Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t bother about it,” replied Tom. “We’ll
bring it to you later. My cousin will want hers anyway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it will give you extra trouble and a longer
walk,” Miss Rindy was ready again to protest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s a walk more or less?” remarked Reed.
“It’s no distance to your cottage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know?” asked Miss Rindy sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your cousin has just told me that it is the second
house beyond the church,” answered Reed triumphantly,
with a sly glance at Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom, with box on shoulder, was keeping pace with
Mabel, while the other three followed, Reed the bundle
bearer. He spoke truly when he said the distance
was short, for in a few minutes they had reached the
cottage where packages and box were deposited, and
the two young men took their leave, promising to
bring the mail later.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as they had stepped off the porch Mabel
seized Ellen’s hands. “Where did you meet him?
Who is he? Tell me quick. That Mr. Clayton came
on the boat. He got on at South Heartwell. He is a
dear. I’m crazy about him. He is such an unaffected
ingenuous sort of lamb. What do you think was his
first question? Did I know how to make clam chowder?
He said they wanted to dig some clams, and he
could make the chowder if he had a good recipe. Oh,
he is a babe, a darling infant. I never met any one
quite like him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “You certainly are bowled over,
Mab. I’ll tell you all about it as soon as I get a
chance. It’s a long story. Now you must have your
supper. I know you must be starved. That trip on
the boat does give one such an appetite.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish it were clam chowder instead of lobster,”
said Mabel as they sat down, “for then we could ask
Mr. Clayton to have supper with us and see if he
likes the kind of chowder we have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if any one could possibly not like our kind;
it’s the best ever,” retorted Ellen. “You can ask him
for some other time; he won’t melt away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do I know what he will or won’t do? If he
stayed to-night, in common decency he’d have to come
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why not ask him to stay?” Miss Rindy
spoke up. “I suppose he might put up with lobsters;
they are not usually despised, and there is an abundance
for all, your young friend, too, Ellen. It will
be mighty handy to have them open that box.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The upshot of the matter was that when the young
men returned with the mail they were urged to stay,
the supper was supplemented by various supplies
which the shoppers had brought from Portland, and
all went merry as the traditional marriage bell. Miss
Rindy promised to make chowder for them if they
would supply the clams, and this offer brought forth
an invitation to come to the studio and partake of a
supper when the chowder should be the center of the
feast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t suppose you have a place to cook it, or
anything to cook it in,” scoffed Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have an excellent oil stove, a large iron pot,
and various other utensils,” Reed boasted. “Suppose
you all make a preliminary visit and take account of
stock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if anything is lacking, I can borrow it from
my cousin,” Tom remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or, if the supply isn’t equal to the demand, we
can bring our own dishes from here,” promised Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a pretty long walk for an old limp-it like me,”
objected Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Limpet? You’re no limpet; they cling close to
the rocks; I’m surprised at you making such a feeble
joke,” said Mabel merrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t mean it for a joke; it’s a solemn fact,”
replied Miss Rindy plaintively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you needn’t walk,” declared Reed. “We’ll
come around in the boat and get you. There is a good
little landing just below the bridge, as I believe you
are aware.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then every one laughed, and Reed declared he
would like to make a study of Ellen in a white dress
and with goldenrod somewhere in the picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Tom insisted that he must do a like study of
Mabel, who blushed and stammered that she was not
paintable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, aren’t you? I should say you were.” Tom
squinted up his eyes and looked at her, causing greater
confusion on her part.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I speak to do Miss Crump, too,” cried Reed;
“she’d make a stunning subject, so much character
to get.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There you go,” exclaimed Tom; “I was going to
speak for her, but I was going about it more diplomatically.
I didn’t mean to blurt out my wishes in
that bald way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter with both of us painting her if
she will be so utterly angelic as to sit for us?” said
Reed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go along with you,” cried Miss Rindy. “The
idea of asking a creature like me to sit; I’m no beauty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear lady,” said Tom, “there is something better
than magazine-cover beauty, and that thing you have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve said it, boy,” Reed agreed. “Come, Miss
Rindy, I may call you that, mayn’t I? You are going
to be good and sit for us. We won’t keep you long,
and we’ll do anything in the world you ask of us, split
wood, run errands, any old thing, won’t we, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, since you have eliminated the claim for
beauty I’ll promise, and you can begin your tasks by
opening that box you brought up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s easy. Lead us to it,” said Reed.</p>

<p class='c009'>So was begun an intimacy, the results of which were
far-reaching.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When we said we didn’t know what might be
around the corner, we must have had a subconscious
awareness of those two boys,” said Mabel, as the two
girls parted for the night. “It’s a lovely world,
Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a lovely island,” sighed Ellen, “but the summer
is flying too fast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Gather rosebuds while ye may,’” quoted Mabel.
“It’s the best summer I ever had, and I mean to make
the most of what is left of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Meaning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Draw your own conclusions, miss. I’m not referring
to ghosts.”</p>

    <div>A NIGHT OF ADVENTURE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There were not many young people summering
on Beatty’s Island. Ellen and Mabel could claim
acquaintance with perhaps half a dozen girls of their
own age, and not so many boys, youths about to enter
college, or, having finished high school, waiting a
chance to enter into business. Dolly and Cora Dix
lived nearest. They were of the flapperish type,
dressed and looked the character, were rather insipid
and silly. Farther away lived Claudia and Lucile
Bond, who affected knickers, were very sporty, and
talked a great deal about “expressing themselves,”
used the latest slang, and liked to be considered mannish.
The Bonds’ nearest neighbors were the Truesdells.
There were three girls in this family, Hettie,
Gertrude, and Cassie, the youngest being Cassie.
These were nice unaffected girls, and their brother,
Alvin, a lad of eighteen, was much like them. Theirs
was a hospitable house, always something going on.
No amount of trouble was too much when it came to
entertaining, and all was done so easily, for every one
took a hand in preparations.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was to the Truesdells’ that Ellen and Mabel went
most frequently, joining forces with them when it
came to excursions, picnics, and the like, and sharing
with them any news which might come their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore they were not slow to tell them of the
late experiences with Tom and Reed. Hettie waved
to the two girls as she saw them coming down the
road. “Join us on the rocks, can’t you?” she called.
“We’re going to have supper on the rocks this evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So sorry, Miss Truesdell,” Ellen answered, “but
we have a previous engagement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s stealing our thunder?” asked Hettie. “I’ll
bet it is those Dix girls; they’re always butting in
when we propose anything.” There was no love lost
between the Truesdell girls and the Dixes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re ’way off,” declared Mabel; “the Dix girls
have nothing to do with it; they’d better not. No, my
dear, we are going over to Minor’s Island to make
clam chowder for two delectable youths.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are they? Who are they?” Hettie stopped
whisking the mayonnaise dressing she was preparing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell her, Ellen. They are your discovery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This Ellen proceeded to do, having an attentive
listener, who at the end of the tale exclaimed: “What
luck! It is the most romantic story I have heard for
an age. Are you going to keep the ‘delectable
youths’ all to yourselves, or are you going to let the
rest of us in on the fun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Hettie Truesdell, what do you take us for?”
cried Mabel. “Of course we want you to meet them.
To-day’s feast is their affair, so we can’t ask any one
to that, but we’ll get up something when we can share
them with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Hettie laughed. “How pleased they would be to
hear us talk of sharing them, as if we were cannibals.
Why can’t they join us on the trip up to Goose Island
that we have planned for day after to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not, indeed? We’ll propose it to them.
Farewell, Hettie; we’ll see you to-morrow and tell
you what happens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They went off to join Miss Rindy, who had gone
ahead to meet the boys at the wharf, and the small
company was soon landed at little Minor’s Island. As
they entered what Tom and Reed were pleased to call
“the studio,” the girls looked around in surprise, for
the boys had made a most attractive place out of the
shabby little building. On the walls they had tacked
building paper, which made an excellent background
for a number of sketches. They had resurrected an
old armchair from the haunted house, had covered it
with stuff of pleasant tone, had made a rough table
and two benches, had covered the floor with rag rugs,
and had put up shelves on which two brass candlesticks
and some bits of pottery were placed as ornaments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are perfect wonders!” exclaimed Mabel.
“You remember what this place looked like when we
first saw it, Ellen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly do, and it looked only fit for chickens
or cows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve worked like Trojans,” Reed told them,
“but it has been great sport. There is a lot more we
can do, but we shall not attempt it this year. We sleep
in the loft, have two bunks there, and here is our
kitchenette.” He opened a door into a small compartment
where stood a blue-flame stove, a few dishes,
and some cooking utensils; a wooden tray held the
clams.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few minutes all fell to work and the chowder
was made ready, proving as satisfactory as expected.
Bread and butter, fruit, coffee, and a large chocolate
cake completed the meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where did you get the cake?” asked Ellen.
“I know you didn’t make it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say not. We bribed Mrs. Dan Ferry to
make it. Most of her boarders have gone and she
could take time to ‘accommodate’ us. She’s hot
stuff when it comes to cooking, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A merry meal it was, and was ended as the sun
went down, leaving rosy clouds reflected in the water.
“It’s as if a heavenly rosebush had been shaken down,”
declared Ellen. “And, oh, those opal and jade waves,
and that exquisite violet and turquoise in the eastern
sky! Aren’t you dying to paint it, Mr. Marshall?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Marshall, indeed,” he replied disgustedly.
“To you I am Cronine, please remember. Yes, Cronette,
I am aching to paint so much that I see that I
could keep busy every hour of the day. But, I tell
you, I mean to come back here, if I am alive next
year. Shall you come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t ask me. How can I tell? I only know
that it is the most wonderful summer I ever spent,
and that it would be too much to expect to repeat it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Miss Rindy’s voice broke in: “Aren’t you
boys going to wash all those dishes? If you’re not,
we will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will not,” announced Tom, who had just
emerged from the little kitchen. “I have put them
in a pan, poured water over them, and there they shall
stay till morning when we can tackle them. There
isn’t any hot water now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So that’s what you have been doing while we outside
have been rhapsodizing,” said Mabel softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s old Tom all over,” said Reed. “He is the
most practical chap, hauls me down from the clouds
a dozen times a day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, once down, you do your share,” declared
Tom. “He goes at it like a whirlwind and gets things
done while I’m thinking about them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They chugged back to Beatty’s in the small motor-boat,
arriving at home in time to catch the last of the
afterglow and to watch the moon emerge from smoky
clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those are nice boys,” remarked Miss Rindy with
satisfaction. “It’s good to get among that kind again.
I knew some of the same sort in France, like that
Tom Clayton, always thinking of some one besides
himself. I believe of the two I like him the best.”
At which remark Ellen had a small feeling of resentment,
although she couldn’t have told why.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two young men were quite ready to accept the
invitation to go on the trip to Goose Island. “We
shall have supper there,” Ellen announced. “We’ll
build a fire; then we can make coffee, fry bacon, and
make those scrumptious sandwiches,—lettuce, mayonnaise,
and the hot bacon between. You’ll go, of
course. Cousin Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I will not. You know I don’t hanker after
those motor-boat trips. I had enough of the water
when I crossed the seas, and I only go now when I
have to. No, please count me out. Who all are
going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Truesdell girls, their brother Alvin, and a
young married cousin with her brother, a boy about
Cassie’s age. There will be ten in all, eleven if you
will go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I’ll have a nice peaceful time at home, with
no young, skittish frivolers about.” Miss Rindy gave
her twisted smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Cousin Rindy,” Ellen protested, “you know
you don’t consider us skittish and frivolous, though
we may be young.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not saying what I consider, though I do say
that if you are going to keep up this everlasting gadding
around you’ll not be fit for much of anything by
the time we get ready to leave, and won’t be in any trim
for the winter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, to-morrow will see about the last of our
frolics,” said Mabel regretfully, “for Alvin leaves
the day after, and there’s no one to run the boat, which
will be stored for the winter. The Truesdells will be
going next week, and by Labor Day there’ll be scarcely
any one left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when do those two boys go? They have a
motor-boat, haven’t they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, a small one. I don’t know how long they
will stay. As long as they can keep warm, they said.
There is no chimney in that place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why couldn’t they move over to the big house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe they will. You might suggest it,” answered
Mabel slyly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy gave a little contemptuous sniff and the
subject was dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Supplied with wraps and carrying various boxes
and baskets, the girls set off for the wharf where
they were met by the rest of the party. Reed and
Tom were on hand, having met the Truesdell girls
the day before, and were helping Alvin stow away
the provisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t forget a jug of water,” Hettie called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And matches, has any one matches?” Gertrude
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>For answer Tom dived down into his pocket and
produced a box which he held up to view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’d better have a can of milk, in case the cream
gives out,” Hettie suggested. “Cassie, you run up to
the store and get it. And see if they have any marshmallows,”
she called after the child who sped off on
her errand.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was back quickly, bringing the can of milk.
“No more marshmallows; all sold out, Mr. Hodges
said, and they aren’t going to get any more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, well, it doesn’t matter. I thought it would
be nice to toast some, but we can get along without.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At last all were aboard, and they pushed off,
rounded a point, and turned toward the upper reaches
of the bay, the small trailer bobbing along in their
wake. The skies were blue and the breezes just fresh
enough to make the girls pull up the collars of their
sweaters. Gulls were soaring and dipping, giving
raucous screams when a fishing boat cast out undesired
objects from the catch. Before five o’clock
Goose Island was reached, and all scrambled ashore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the fireplace,” cried Gertrude, plunging
through the bushes to reach a point where, earlier in
the season, a fireplace of stones had been built up.
“Now you masculines go hunting for driftwood while
we unpack the baskets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a short time wood enough was gathered, the
coffee was bubbling merrily, and the bacon sizzling in
the pan. There were several dashes away from the
fire to escape the puffs of smoke, and one pan of
bacon was overturned, causing a mighty conflagration
for the moment, but that was the only mishap. Hettie
was chief cook, with Ellen as assistant, and the supper
served did them credit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know why it is that everything always
tastes so wonderfully good when we go on these
picnics,” remarked Mabel, nibbling a sandwich; “and I
eat twice as much as upon any other occasion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So say we all of us,” Reed chimed in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In spite of what you say,” said Hettie, “we always
bring too much. Just look at all this stuff.
Shall we feed it to the fishes or lug it back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My frugal mind would suggest that it would be a
wicked waste to throw it away,” said Ellen. “‘What
they could not eat that day they had the next day
fried,’ remember.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” returned Hettie, “we’ll obey your
frugal mind’s suggestion and pack it away. Nobody
can tell what the morrow may bring forth. You’d
better begin to stow away these things in the boat,
boys, for we must start right back if we want to get
home before night. It gets dark so soon these days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The tide was out by now, and great stretches of
slippery seaweed lay between the shore and the boat,
but, by dint of using the board seats as a bridge, all
were helped safely aboard, and the return trip began.
The sun had set in a glow of amber light, and all
seemed fair for the voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her go, Alvin,” cried Reed as he pushed off
and then made a flying leap to land in the boat. He
scrambled over to a place by Ellen. “I don’t like the
look of that gray bank along the east,” he said in a
low tone to her, “but I reckon we can make it. Whoop
her up, boy,” he called to Alvin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do you think it means we shall have a storm?”
quavered the Truesdells’ cousin, Mrs. Olmstead, who
had heard what Reed said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a storm, but fog. It may come up quickly,
or it may hang around outside, but we know the
channel pretty well, and there’s no danger. I’ve
cruised around in these waters so much this summer
that I could steer in the dark. I’ve learned a lot from
the fishermen, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They chugged along steadily for some time, then
suddenly the boat stopped short, gave a few futile
wheezes, went on a little distance, and then came to a
dead standstill, or as much of a one as a boat afloat
could do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello! What’s wrong?” cried Tom and Reed in
unison, as they climbed over to where Alvin was striving
in vain to right matters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s look at her,” said Tom, gazing down into
the depths where the engine was. He and Alvin consulted,
experimented, did their best, but the boat still
lopped helplessly around, drifting with the outgoing
tide. “I’m blest if I know what’s wrong,” said Tom,
lifting his head at last. “Nothing seems to be out
of order so far as I can see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks all right to me,” Alvin agreed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t suppose by any chance it needs some juice,”
remarked Reed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never thought of that,” replied Alvin, grinning
sheepishly. “I gave the can to Sam Denny and told
him to fill her up, so it must be stowed away somewhere.”
He began to search.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s horrid, this lopping around,” complained little
Mrs. Olmstead. “Do help to look for the can, Bert,”
she said to her brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>He joined in the search, but it was to no avail, and
at last Alvin stood up and shook his fist in the direction
of the distant Beatty’s Island. “Doggone that Sam
Denny!” he exclaimed. “He’s forgotten to put it
in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean we can’t go on?” cried Mrs. Olmstead
in horrified tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one answered. The young men looked at each
other, then looked off across the water to discover the
nearest land. “There’s nothing to do but to row for
it,” said Reed to Alvin, “and the longer we wait the
farther out we’ll drift.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’d better waste no time over it,” returned
Alvin, clambering over the seats and drawing up the
little trailer alongside. He crawled in, Reed following,
and they plied the oars vigorously, the larger boat in
tow. It was a hard pull, but by degrees the distance
to shore lessened, and at last they reached dry land.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have we got to spend the night here?” asked little
Mrs. Olmstead with a hysterical sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There might be worse places,” said Bert. “There
are no wild beasts or poisonous snakes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it will soon be dark, and we’ve no place to
sleep,” responded his sister tremulously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wouldn’t mind going to a dance and staying
up pretty near all night,” retorted Bert.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t fuss, children; don’t fuss,” urged Hettie.
“We’ll manage somehow. What worries me the most
is that Mother will be distracted. She’ll think something
dreadful has happened, that we’re drowned, or
gobbled up by sharks, or some little thing like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cousin Rindy will be worried, too,” remarked Ellen.
“I wish there were some way to let her know
we are safe. If we could only broadcast the news, for
instance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry; we’ll find some way out,” Reed assured
her. “The first thing is to see if we can find
some sort of shelter before it gets too dark to explore,
and then we’ll decide what to do next. Come
on, boys, let’s see what the jungle has to disclose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The three young men, with Bert, plunged into a
thicket, and disappeared, leaving the girls huddled together
on the rocks, Mrs. Olmstead shedding futile
tears, the others discussing the situation and suggesting
ways to meet it. Once in a while Gertrude, who
had brought a flash-light, turned it in the direction
whither the boys had gone. The island where they
had landed was but a small one, and there were no
signs of a habitation upon it, only a little stretch of
sandy beach, rocks above it, and, beyond, a grove of
fir trees with a few birches interspersed.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a little while the crackle of twigs announced the
return of the exploring party.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a little dilapidated log hut in there,” announced
Alvin as he came crashing through the underbrush;
“it isn’t much of a place, but it’s better than
nothing, and will give us shelter. We’d better get to it
before it’s any darker. I’ll lead the way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls followed him in single file. Only glimmers
of light sifted down through the sombre firs, and
it was necessary to be careful of the footing lest one
stumble and come to grief. At last they reached the
spot where Tom and Reed were busily gathering
boughs to fling upon the floor of the cabin, which was
a rough structure, one side open to the winds. There
was no chimney, and through chinks between the logs
one could peer out into the surrounding thicket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, you all make yourselves as comfortable as
you can,” suggested Tom, “while we fellows go back
for the baskets and things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gee! I’m glad you didn’t throw away all that
provender,” exclaimed Bert. “We’ll be as hungry as
the dickens before morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Bert!” wailed his sister again, lapsing into
tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed tossed his overcoat to Ellen. “Keep that,”
he said; “I’ll not need it yet a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bert, you’d better stay here and keep off the
bears,” charged Alvin. “We are going after the baskets.”
Then with Tom and Reed he went off.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel snuggled up close to Ellen. “If we wanted
adventure we surely have it,” she whispered. “It’s
getting sort of shivery. I’m glad we brought warm
wraps, although they seemed superfluous when we
started out, didn’t they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we would have left them at home if Cousin
Rindy hadn’t insisted that we would need them. She
certainly is a wise old dear. No doubt she will sit up
all night watching for us. I don’t mind anything so
much as having her do that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What I want to know is how we are to get off
this island even in daylight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m trusting to the boys to find a way, and I’m
sure they’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were not long left in doubt, for soon the
forms of Alvin and Tom were seen approaching in
the gathering darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three of you went forth. Where is the third?”
inquired Mabel. “Have you thrown him to the sea-god
to propitiate him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tom set down the basket he carried, but did not
answer for a moment; then he burst out with, “That
Reed Marshall is the darndest fellow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s he done now?” came in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s taken the rowboat and is on his way back to
Beatty’s. While we were gathering up the baskets and
things he slyly cut loose and made off before we could
stop him. I shouted to him to come back, but he said
we must stand by; that he’d take word to Mrs. Truesdell
and Miss Crump, tell them you all were safe, and
that he’d be back with help as early in the morning as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is it safe for him to go so far, and at night?”
asked Ellen tremulously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a pretty long pull, but he has the grit to make
it. He’s strong and has some top piece. He’ll put it
across if any one can, but I did hate to see him go
off alone; it didn’t seem fair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you go with him, Alvin?” Hettie
spoke up sharply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Clayton has just told you that he was off before
we knew it, and when we tried to argue with
him he said it wasn’t worth while for more than one
to take the risk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen gave a quick gasp and clutched Mabel, who
gave her hand an answering pressure. Mrs. Olmstead,
as usual, had recourse to tears. “Alvin, you’re
an idiot,” said Hettie crossly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reed’ll make it; I should worry,” insisted Tom.
“Now all of you try to get a little sleep, if you can.
Alvin and I will keep watch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was little sleep any one had that night, resting on
the strewn branches and beds of dry leaves. It grew
very cold before morning, so that Ellen realized why
Reed had given her his coat. She drew a long quivering
sigh and offered up a silent prayer for his safety.
It was a relief when dawn came. One by one crept
out of the cabin, and stole down to the rocks to gaze
over the rose-flecked water and catch the first glimpse
of an approaching boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last a small, dark speck appeared. It came
nearer and nearer, steadily heading toward them.
“Ahoy there!” cried Tom on the outmost edge of
rock. “Ahoy!” came back the answer. A few minutes
later the boat was near enough for them to recognize
its occupants, but Reed was not one of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center c007'>
    <div>AN INHERITANCE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Every one crowded around as the boat drew up
and two men jumped out. “Are you from
Beatty’s Island?” inquired more than one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right you are,” was the reply. “Young man
came in along about three o’clock, been rowing pretty
near all night, he said; was nigh all in, got off his
course, kinder foggy for a time, but he got back again.
Beats me how he done it, not being used to these
waters, but he said he knew which way the wind blew,—lots
of sense he had,—and steered according. I take
off my hat to a landsman that could make his way in
the dark like that. Of course any of us men could
do it, being as much at home on these waters as
ashore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where is he? Where is he?” Ellen interrupted
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man chuckled. “Lady by name o’ Crump’s
got him in tow, stowed him away in bed, sot a big
nigger to watch that he didn’t get away, come down
herself and routed us up, told us a party was marooned
off here and we’d got to come after ’em, which
we was willing to do. We was going out to draw out
lowbster pots anyway. What’s wrong? Engine gone
dead on you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Juice gave out,” replied Alvin shortly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah-h, I see; that does happen in the best regerlated
families, sometimes, specially when you hev a
load of pretty wimmin folks along,” said the man
with a sly wink at Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wal, if juice is all you want, we can load you up
and go about our business,” said the second man.
“No, glad to accommodate you.” He shook his head
as Alvin tendered more than the price of the gasoline.
“So long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gasoline provided, the men went off to their
lobster pots, and the marooned party consumed the
remnants of yesterday’s feast before they set out for
home, Tom having built a fire and made coffee earlier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For shipwrecked mariners cast away on a desert
island I think we are faring pretty well,” remarked
Hettie. “Who was the foresighted person who
thought to provide extra coffee?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ellen, of course,” answered Mabel. “She always
thinks of the useful things; Useful Ellen we call her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t give me the credit,” Ellen protested. “It
is all Cousin Rindy’s training.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there had to be something to build on,” Mabel
asserted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last of the provisions disappeared before they
started off, Bert in no wise unwilling to despatch large
slices of cake at that hour of the morning. So, cheered
and sustained, they made a quiet journey without any
regrets because of the adventure, now that it was over.
Mrs. Olmstead was the only grumbler, but nobody
listened to her, and they arrived at their wharf quite
cheerful.</p>

<p class='c009'>To their surprise it was Reed who was first to greet
them. “Why, we thought you were in bed under
strict guard,” said Ellen as he helped her ashore; “behind
locked doors we understood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I was, but fortunately there were windows
from which I escaped. Miss Rindy believes I am still
peacefully sleeping.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should have had a good rest after that terrible
trip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t terrible, rather exciting, and I was pretty
well tuckered out when I reached here, but I’ve had a
good sleep and am ‘pert as a lizard.’ But, tell me,
how did you get along?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well indeed. That good Tom Clayton just
laid himself out to do everything in his power to make
us comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you he was a mighty good sort. As soon
as you’re rested, Cronette, and have had your breakfast
I have something to tell you.” He looked at her
gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not a bit tired and I’ve had breakfast, thank
you. Tell me now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I don’t want to hurry over it. We must have
a quiet place and a quiet hour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You look so serious; I hope it isn’t bad news.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is in one way, but not in another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You rouse my curiosity to the highest pitch. Let’s
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy was as astonished to see Reed as she
was glad to see Ellen. “I’d like to know where you
came from!” she exclaimed as the two entered. “I
told you not to get up till noon, and I told Beulah to
lock that door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You forgot there are windows, a porch roof, and
posts, dear madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you madam me; I’m a spinster, you sly,
crafty youth. Well, Ellen, you did get back safe,
thanks to this boy. I hope you’re none the worse for
your outing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a bit. I hope you are none the worse for
your vigil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As if I wasn’t used to sitting up all night. I did
it times without number over there in France, and
often enough before that.” She was not going to let
Ellen think that she had been anxious about her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Mabel, accompanied by Tom, entered. “I
feel as if I had been away a year,” exclaimed the girl.
“I hope I find you well, Miss Crump.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As well as anybody could feel after all this hulla-baloo.
Getting me up at the dead hours of the night
with a crazy tale of castaways.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but you were up already, Miss Rindy,” declared
Reed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I hadn’t gone to bed, that’s true. I must
have fallen asleep in my chair, and didn’t realize the
time.” She gave a little laugh, which belied her words,
and then turned the subject by saying that they must
have some breakfast; and, in spite of the fact that all
insisted that they needed none, she set aside their assertions,
claiming that she and Reed wanted some if
nobody else did, so all sat down together, and, with
new appetites, whetted by their morning trip on the
water, did justice to Beulah’s waffles.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later Reed and Ellen sought a sheltered
corner under the shadow of a great rock. Just as
they were leaving the house Mabel ran after them,
waving a letter. “Miss Rindy says she forgot to give
you this; it came in the mail after we left yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen took the letter, glanced at the typewritten address,
and slipped it into the pocket of the coat she
wore. Then, with Reed, she seated herself. “Now
tell me your news,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed was silent for a moment, then he drew from
his pocket a letter which he spread out upon his knee.
“This is from Uncle Pete’s lawyer,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don Pedro’s lawyer? What’s he writing to you
about? Have you been doing anything reprehensible?”
Ellen asked flippantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. One doesn’t always receive letters from lawyers
because of misdemeanors; there are such things
as wills, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen stared at him for a moment in speechless silence;
then, as a possible meaning of his words reached
her, she gasped, “You don’t mean—you can’t mean
that dear Don Pedro is—is——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed nodded. “He was taken ill in the mountains
where he was spending the summer, and lived but a
few days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen covered her face with her hands, then raised
wet eyes to Reed’s grave face. “Your letter, what
does it say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It tells me that to his godson and namesake he
has left the contents of his studio, including all his
pictures except such as are bequeathed to some one
mentioned in another clause of the will. He also
leaves me ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you said his namesake,” returned Ellen, looking
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My legal name is Peter Reed Marshall. Uncle
Pete didn’t like the name of Peter, so I dropped it
and always have been called Reed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear Don Pedro,” murmured Ellen with a faraway
look. “How we shall miss him! It was fine
for him to remember you in that way. I am glad he
did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was just like him to do it. He has always encouraged
me to go on with my studies, even when it
was hard sledding and it looked as if I couldn’t make
my way. He always came to my rescue, and told me
not to sell my soul for Mammon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Ellen looked puzzled. “But I thought you
were very well off. I never dreamed that you had
any sort of struggle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What made you think so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, the violin. You paid a good price for it,
you know, and how could you, if money wasn’t easy
to get?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed flushed up. “You’ve caught me, Cronette.
I paid for it with the check Uncle Pete gave me for
Christmas, and he made up the rest. He wanted me
to have it if you couldn’t keep it, said it should not go
to a stranger. He knew how I longed for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear, dear Don Pedro,” again sighed Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wanted me to have it, didn’t you, Cronette?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I did, you know I did, and now, since I know
you so well, I am more than ever glad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It brought us together, and so I value it more
than ever,” said Reed softly. “Cronette, I think you’d
better look at your letter. From the look of the envelope
I believe it is from that same lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen hurriedly drew forth the letter, opened it, read
it hastily, then, after handing it to Reed, buried her
face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t cry, dear,” she heard Reed say in a few minutes;
and he drew her hands away from her face,
gently enfolding them in his.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—but,” quavered Ellen, “I can’t help it. It
was so lovely of him to think of me in that way, to
leave me the pictures my father painted and that he
bought at the sale when Mother had to part with
everything. And to leave me five thousand dollars,
too. I can’t help being overcome.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, of course you can’t. The lawyer says there
is a letter of instructions, and that he will forward me
a copy of the part that concerns me. Perhaps you will
get one, too. I know Uncle Pete often spoke of having
an exhibition of his pictures and your father’s, a
joint affair. We must follow out his wishes, Cronette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen agreed with him, and they sat a long time
talking over this unlooked-for situation. Little curling
waves rippled in at their feet, “nosing around among
the rocks like a dog,” said Reed. He looked off over
the blue expanse to the hazy horizon line. “And
over there is Spain,” he said musingly. “I want to
go there some day, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are many, many places I should like to go,
but I shall never leave Cousin Rindy while she needs
me; if she could go, too, that would be another thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed made no answer, but continued to look off
across the sea. Meanwhile Miss Rindy and Mabel, all
unaware of the subject which so engrossed the two
outside, were talking of Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you would encourage Ellen to spend the
winter with me,” Mabel began. “She has so much
talent and could study at the Peabody, go to the concerts,
and all that. She should have a musical career,
don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy answered after a pause. “I’m not sure
that it would be the wise thing. What would your
grandmother think of it, of Ellen making a convenience
of her house?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t think Gran would mind. I must admit
that she is something of a snob, a thing I despise,
and that while she is generous in giving where it
doesn’t mean a sacrifice on her part, she doesn’t care
to give of herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And giving of one’s self is the only real unselfishness,”
Miss Rindy interrupted. “If Ellen couldn’t
make as good an appearance as your other friends, and
couldn’t return her obligations, I would rather she did
not go, certainly not for a whole winter. She has
talent, maybe, but she isn’t a great genius, and only
that could compensate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she is such a dear,” returned Mabel wistfully.
“No one could help loving her, for she has what is
known as charm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She has her faults, but then no one is perfect, and
I don’t expect her to be. There is one thing I may
say, and that is, she is the only person in the world
to whom I come first. I never did come first to any
one till Ellen entered my life. I never was much
considered in my own home, therefore you can understand
that Ellen, her happiness, her future, mean a lot
to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do understand,” returned Mabel feelingly, for
she thought Miss Rindy’s statements very pathetic;
“and I can say one thing, and that is, she never
for one moment forgets what you have done for
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gratitude is such a rare thing, especially in one as
young as Ellen, that the fact makes me the more
anxious to safeguard her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you do want her to follow a musical career,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So far as it may be necessary for her happiness.
I don’t want her to expect great things and then fail
in the accomplishment, to risk all and fail. She’d
better be a big frog in a little puddle than try to be a
bigger frog in a puddle where she’d be crowded out.
In other words, she will always be able to make a living
in Marshville, while she might starve in the city.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but Marshville!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t a bad place to live, but if straws show
which way the wind blows she won’t always live
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean what I mean. Time will show. From
all indications I should say she will live there for some
years yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I hope all her summers, yours, too, and mine,
can be spent up here. You will come next year, won’t
you, Miss Rindy? Don’t you like it, and haven’t we
had a happy, free time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy gave her attention to counting stitches
on the knitting she had in hand, then she answered:
“You have given us a wonderful time, my dear, but
in my experience it isn’t best to expect to repeat one’s
good times. Things are seldom twice the same.
Something is sure to happen that will alter conditions.
In this world the only thing you can count on is
change.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, one thing can be counted upon, and that is
my desire to repeat this summer’s experiences.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That may be your desire at this moment, but it
may not be six months hence. We all may be a thousand
miles apart by next year; one can never tell.
That vocation you are so fond of talking about may
take you to China or—somewhere else,” she added
with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before Mabel could expostulate Ellen came in. She
went directly to her cousin, and, opening her letter,
laid it before her. “Read that,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy hastily glanced over it “Why, Ellen!
Why, Ellen!” she exclaimed. “What a surprise! I
am sorry that dear good man is gone, but I can’t help
being glad for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mayn’t I come in on the surprise?” asked Mabel
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did I say about changes?” Miss Rindy returned,
as she handed over the letter which Mabel
read immediately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it isn’t a fortune,” she commented, “but
if those pictures sell well, it will swell the sum. I
must spread the news abroad and get all my friends
interested. I’ll buy one myself, and make Gran do the
same, so you can count on two purchasers, at least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is Reed?” asked Miss Rindy. “Does he
know about this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He does indeed, for he is mentioned in the will,
too.” Then she told of what had been left to Reed.
“He has gone to hunt up Tom,” she informed
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So probably we have seen the last of them this
day,” remarked Miss Rindy with one of her twisted
smiles. “I declare when I think of that boy rowing
nearly all night out in that fog, I don’t know what
to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say he is a he-man,” responded Mabel. “I
thought Tom was about the nicest ever, but now I may
change my mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take care,” Miss Rindy spoke warningly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of what or whom?” inquired Mabel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You should know without me saying,” replied
Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” both girls flushed up, “I want to see him
to congratulate him,” said Mabel. “Isn’t he coming
back, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This afternoon, but please don’t congratulate him.
We have both lost a dear friend, and just now we can
think only of that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, dear, I should have remembered.”
Mabel spoke regretfully, and went over to put her arm
around Ellen. Both girls had gained in weight and
color. A row of tiny freckles had appeared on the
bridge of Ellen’s nose, but her cheeks were rosy and
her eyes bright, while Mabel was tanned and had lost
a listless air which had been hers on her arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy, looking at them, remarked upon their
exuberant health. “This place surely doesn’t owe us
anything,” she remarked. “I never saw such improvement
in two beings, and as for myself I feel like
a four-year-old. As for Beulah, she’s grown so fat
she can scarcely waddle, and such an appetite! I
don’t see how we can afford to feed her when we get
back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, we can, now,” Ellen assured her. “No
doubt she will lose her appetite when she gets away
from this stimulating air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only another week of it,” sighed Mabel. “The
Palmers have gone, the Truesdells are beginning to
pack up, and pretty soon all the lights alongshore will
be out. Aunt Zenobia Simpson says she hates to see
the last one go, but a lot of the natives are glad when
they can have their island to themselves, and I don’t
blame them. I suppose Reed and Tom are over at
H. H.,” which was the way they spoke of the haunted
house among themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, Reed said there was a lot to do there. They
want us to go over for a parting supper there to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is a dear place,” Mabel spoke reminiscently.
“I’d like nothing better than to come up here every
summer with you two and be sure that those boys
would be over there. We have had such good times
together. Oh, why can’t good times last forever?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They would cease to be good times after a while,
and become only monotonous ones,” observed Miss
Rindy sagely.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day brought them to their final visit to
the little studio across the bridge, where a greater
feast than usual was spread. The young artists gave
each guest one of their sketches as a parting souvenir,
Reed played a farewell rhapsody, and they went slowly
home, lingering to watch a young moon, escorted by
the evening star, dip down behind the line of peaked
firs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sea was a little rough and boomed upon the
rocks, a big wave once in a while hissing in, breaking
thunderously, and then subsiding into a line of foam
which was beginning to form creamy balls of spindrift.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they stepped upon the porch a dark form arose
from the steps. It was Beulah, who had been watching
the surf. “Dat wahtah sutt’nly do bus’ up pretty,”
was her remark as she followed the party into the
house.</p>

    <div>FIDDLE AND I</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The beautiful summer was over, and those in the
cottage, which they had named “Spindrift,”
must bid farewell to the rocks and waves, to the blueberry
bushes and the sombre woods. The song sparrows
had flown and the wild ducks had come. Cap’n
Belah’s apples were gathered in, and the door of his
house, which had stood wide open all summer, was
now closed against the searching winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little steamboat was now making but one trip
a day. The young man who all summer had run a
jitney, now had departed for larger fields, so those
who wished to reach the wharf must “foot it,” as
Cap’n Belah said. The sun had not been up very long
when the party from “Spindrift” cottage started
down the road, Reed and Tom carrying bags and
suit-cases, and Beulah lumbering along in the rear,
weighted down with bundles. As most of the summer
visitors had left, there were but few to wave farewell
as the little boat steamed off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we’ll all come back next summer, won’t we?”
said Mabel brightly as they turned a point which hid
the island from view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall if I have to swim,” responded Tom.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I, too, if I have to walk,” Reed avowed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I, if I have to hire an aëroplane,” Ellen said
laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can count on you, can’t we, Miss Rindy?”
Mabel asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I make no rash promises,” was the answer.
“Who knows where we all may be another summer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>This somewhat subdued the exuberance and confidence
of the young people, and they began to chatter
and make plans for the day which they would spend
in Portland before taking the night train. The two
young men had arranged to go as far as New York
with their friends, and Mabel had decided to spend a
few days there with her aunt. She tried to dissuade
Ellen from going on to Marshville with her cousin.
“I don’t see why both of you can’t stop off for a
little while,” she urged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what would we do with Beulah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Make a bale of her and send her by freight,” suggested
Reed; “ship her as dry-goods, or, better still,
as foodstuff, marked perishable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Food-stuffed, you’d better say,” remarked Ellen,
looking over toward the corner where Beulah, having
partaken of an insufficient breakfast, was munching
such left-overs as she had been able to stow away in a
capacious pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even Miss Rindy laughed, but agreed with Ellen
that the problem of how to dispose of Beulah in New
York would be too intricate to be considered. “If she
adds much more to her weight, they will be charging
us double fare,” she remarked. “I think she must
have gained twenty pounds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So on they went to Marshville, Ellen expecting to
join Mabel in New York when the joint exhibition of
pictures should take place. Reed was to look after
this, and Ellen knew he could be depended upon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore the next day saw them back at home,
and soon everything was going on as before, and the
summer was remembered as a lovely dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caro was the first to give them greeting. She came
first thing in the morning to give and receive news.
Sally Cooper was engaged to a man from Meadowville,
but wasn’t going to be married for a year, as
her family thought she was too young. Clyde Fawcett
was going with a girl from the city; she was a niece
of Mrs. Craig Hale, and had been visiting Marshville.
Frank Ives was just getting over typhoid fever, had
been ill all summer, as Ellen knew from Caro’s letters.
Then Ellen told of her good times, but not a
word did she say of her windfall; that could wait, or
not be told at all. So they talked till Jeremy Todd
came in and Caro left. To Jeremy Ellen unburdened
her heart, and learned from him that he, too, had been
remembered in the will of his old friend Peter Barstow,
and that an annuity of five hundred dollars was
to be his. After his death this was to be continued,
under certain conditions, paid to the person or persons
named in a private letter left with the testator’s lawyer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can imagine that dear Don Pedro rather enjoyed
creating a little mystery,” remarked Ellen. “I
am so glad, dear Music Master, that this has come to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am pleased, too,” asserted Mr. Todd. “Strange
that it should win one more respect from some quarters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen wondered if he referred to his wife, and
hoped he did. Anything which increased her respect
for her husband was not to be regretted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Frank Ives, still very wan and pale, lost no time in
coming to call. His illness, which took him very near
to the dark valley, had subdued him and had taken
away a certain over-confidence, so that Ellen liked
him better. There never had been anything snobbish
about Frank, but he had been a little too self-satisfied.
If Ellen was kinder than before, it was that her sympathies
were aroused, and she made promises to ride
and walk with the lad, promises which sent him away
in a happy mood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the autumn passed. Reed wrote often, reporting
progress of his affairs. Mr. Barstow’s studio
was his until the lease was up in the spring. Tom
Clayton was sharing it with him. They were going
over the pictures and hoped to have the exhibition and
sale some time in December.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mabel wrote sometimes from New York, sometimes
from Baltimore. She said less about her vocation and
more about improving her mind. Ellen wondered
when she would settle down to anything stable. “She
will be steadfast enough once she really makes up her
mind what she wants to do,” Ellen said to Miss Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The trouble is that she has no set duty,” Miss
Rindy answered. “She is the sort of girl who should
marry and have something to tie to. I wish she would.
Does she ever mention Tom Clayton? He is the man
for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She mentions him once in a while, calls him a dear
old thing. I sometimes wonder if she would mention
him more, or less, if she were really interested in him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just like a woman to take that sly way of
covering her tracks and keep you guessing,” Miss
Rindy asserted.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mabel did not keep them guessing very long,
for before the first of the year Ellen received a letter
which said: “Rejoice with me! I have found my
vocation and its name is David Harland. Are you
surprised, dear? I can assure you that I am. How
such a wise, steady, unworldly being could be attracted
to a girl brought up in such an atmosphere as I have
been is a mystery to me. David is professor of botany
and is going to South America next year, it being his
Sabbatical year. He is some years older than I am,
but we are very congenial, and I am as happy as the
day is long. We shall be married just before we sail
in June. Of course Gran thinks I am a first-class idiot
because I did not choose a social star, but she is somewhat
compensated by the fact that she will bring out
my frivolous little cousin next winter, and will have
the joy of directing her costumes and witnessing her
conquests. Tell Miss Rindy she is the daughter of a
prophet. How could she have foreseen that I was to
fly so far away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then followed loving messages, and promises to
write more fully another time. Ellen folded the letter
with a sigh. “Poor Tom,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure it is ‘poor Tom’?” asked Miss
Rindy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I surmise so, but one can’t be sure. He certainly
was devoted last summer, and I know Mabel liked
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not well enough to marry him. Well, she
certainly has given us a big surprise. Has she ever
mentioned this man to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Once or twice very casually. I imagine she was
quite bowled over early in the game, but was not sure
how he felt, and so didn’t want to reveal her interest
in him. I’m crazy to see him, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to, yes. I hope he is the right man for
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen sighed again. “This puts an end to all our
plans for next summer,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I warned you, my child, not to count on anything
but changes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But what changes were in store for them no one
could foresee, especially Orinda Crump, who prophesied
them. Ellen found her one day, just before
Christmas, sitting with her hands in her lap, looking
aimlessly out of the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There wasn’t any mail, Cousin Rindy,” Ellen announced.
“I looked in our box on my way home
from practising.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I brought it home,” Miss Rindy told her, “and I
wish I had lost it, or that the mail bag had burned up
before it reached here or anything that would have
spared me from getting that letter.” She pointed
tragically to one which she had flung from her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it bad news?” asked Ellen anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know whether it is bad or good; some
might call it good news, I suppose, but I’m not going;
I’m not, so there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Going where?” Ellen looked bewildered. “Do
tell me what has happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may as well know first as last. I have had a
letter from my brother. His wife is dead, leaving a
daughter about twelve years old, and Al asks me to
go out and take charge of things, says he is in poor
health, has enough means to assure me a comfortable
home, sentimentalizes over our childhood days—a
happy childhood I had, didn’t I? After all these
years pretends he has just awakened to the fact that
he might have been a less indifferent brother. Now
when he needs me he begins to see the light; just like
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you aren’t going, are you?” Ellen knelt down
and took one of her cousin’s hands, fondling it as she
spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Ellen, I don’t know. I said I wouldn’t, but
perhaps it’s my duty, and I don’t believe I ever was
one to shirk. It’s a hard question to decide, a hard
question.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cousin Rindy, please don’t go. Just as things
are getting easier for us it would be too bad. What
with my little windfall and what will be realized from
the sale of my father’s pictures we shall not have to
pinch and screw as we have done. I have been rejoicing
that I could do something toward lifting your
burdens, and now——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nonsense! as if you hadn’t lifted my burdens times
without number. I’m not one to palaver, as you know,
but I tell you, Ellen, that you have been the greatest
comfort to me. Of course we’ve had our spats; and
I’ve been as much to blame in them as you, but take
it by and large I don’t believe two persons could live
together more harmoniously than we have done. How
do I know what that child of Al’s is like? Spoiled,
probably, and hard to manage. With you I’ve had it
all my own way, with no one to interfere if I wanted
to shake you or box your ears.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Cousin Rindy, you never did such things,”
Ellen expostulated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I say I had? I only said I might have wanted
to, which no doubt I did sometimes. I repeat, there
was no one to interfere, and in Al’s home I should
have to answer to him. Well, I’ll have to think it
over. It isn’t to be decided ‘hot off the bat,’ as my
boys used to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what would become of me if you deserted
me?” asked Ellen dolorously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, Ellen, that’s just it. It’s been a question
with me for some time whether or not I was doing
right to keep you here. You love that artist life; you
have good friends in the city. What do you say to
trying it out for a year while I try it out in Seattle?
Then, if we make up our minds that we don’t like it,
we can come back here and settle down for good and
all. We’ll think it over before I say yea or nay to this
proposition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So the matter was left for the present, and Ellen
went about her affairs as usual. The tears would fill
her eyes as she thought of putting the continent between
herself and her cousin, yet when the picture of
city life arose before her it held its charm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed wrote from time to time. Just now he was
absorbed in the exhibition which was taking place at
one of the galleries. A creditable number of pictures
had been sold; others would be auctioned off at the
close, and certain ones, if not sold, would be withdrawn,
and offered later. Ellen watched eagerly for
the reports, valuing the appreciation shown as much as
the material returns.</p>

<p class='c009'>A week passed in which Albert Crump’s proposition
was discussed daily from all points of view. Miss
Rindy hesitated because she did not want Ellen to go
to the city alone. “I don’t see why you couldn’t go
with me,” she suggested at one time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but what would I do when I got there?” said
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You could be a companion for Teresa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “She is twelve and I am nearly
nineteen; I’m afraid we wouldn’t have much in common,
especially if she is spoiled. I don’t believe you
have spoiled me, Cousin Rindy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope not, and I don’t mean to spoil her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mabel says that she and I are very unmodern and
behind the times, but I don’t think I am of the clinging-vine
order, and I believe I could be as independent
as the next if I were thrown on my own resources.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you could be; all the same I don’t like to
think of you in the city alone. If you could go to the
Austins, or if that nice Mr. Barstow were still living
and could watch over you, I wouldn’t so much mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If that dear man were living, probably I wouldn’t
have the means to go, unless I found some sort of
position. Don’t worry about me, Cousin Rindy, if
that’s all that keeps you from accepting.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure it would be a great experience and give
me a chance to see that part of the country, and I
don’t have to stay, even if Albert does pay my fare,
for I shall not promise to remain there for more than
a year. After that we shall see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So at last the matter was settled, the proposition was
accepted, and Miss Rindy was to be gone a year. The
Dove-Hales had some friends who were eager to rent
Miss Crump’s house, furnished, and there was much
to be done before the first of February, when the occupants
decided to leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Caro dissolved in tears when she heard the news.
Jeremy heaved a sigh and shook his head. “My little
song bird is leaving her nest. I fear she will not come
back to it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then one day appeared Reed. “I just had to
come,” he said as Ellen greeted him at the door. “It’s
all over but the shouting, and I knew you would want
to know. Besides,” he added after a short pause, “I
just had to see you; couldn’t stand it any longer.
Why, it’s been nearly three months, Cronette, and my
patience is stretched to the breaking point. Glad to
see me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I am,” Ellen assured him. “Well, how
did it go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better than I expected. We sold more than half
for fair prices. Those at the auction didn’t bring
what we could wish, but we still have a number in
reserve which I shall place from time to time at some
of the big galleries, so eventually we shall realize a
pretty decent sum. Are you satisfied, my dear co-heir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly. I think you have managed excellently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They say artists don’t usually have much business
sense, but I really believe I shall develop some. I
don’t know how it would be if I had to handle my
own wares, probably I might fall down on such transactions,
but given the proper incentive I believe I
could put it over.” He beamed down upon her, and
she gave him smile for smile, aware that it was good
to see his tall figure, to look into his clear, honest
eyes, and was surprised when a sudden desire to stroke
his hair came over her. It was queer that she felt so,
and suddenly her eyes fell before his steady gaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>She moved her chair a little farther away from his,
and for a short space silence fell between them. Then
Reed roused himself to say, “What’s your news,
Cronette? I’ve told you mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen wavered a moment before she determined to
tell him. “Cousin Rindy is going out to Seattle for a
year, maybe longer, to be with her brother. It has
just been settled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott! You don’t say so? And what’s to
become of you? Don’t tell me you are going, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I am not. Mabel wanted me to spend the
winter with her, but she is so absorbed in getting ready
to be married,—I wrote you of that, you know,—that
I don’t think I would feel as if I fitted into the
scheme of things. I’d be like a little brown wren in
a cage of birds of paradise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Humph! not much you would. Of course I remember
what you said about Miss Wickham’s engagement,
and, if I didn’t, old Tom wouldn’t let me forget.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Reed——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cronine, please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cronine, then. Do you think Tom is very hard
hit?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think he was at first, but he is now in the convalescent
stage, is contemplating a mental change of
scene, is shunting the picture of Miss Mabel off the
stage, and is substituting another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a gaudy blonde when I left; I don’t know
who it will be when I get back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen laughed. “He must be rather a fickle individual.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He might be called so in his present development,
but I think he’d stick, given the proper lure. I’m
built on different lines; when I fall I fall hard and
stay right there forever and aye. There’s one thing,
Cronette, that I’ve been saving to tell you, and that is
I have bought the haunted house; got it for next to
nothing, the owners were that glad to get rid of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, R—Cronine, you have really bought it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certain sure, the whole outfit,—studio, trees, garden,
all the whole thing, and I’m going to change the
name of ‘haunted house.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That depends upon you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Reed nodded. “I remember last summer that you
said you would never leave your cousin while she
needed you. She will stop needing you if she goes to
her brother, and so what it’s been as hard as the mischief
to keep from saying I’m going to say. Don’t
you think it would be nice if we could always spend
our summers up there on little Minor’s Island, you,
and fiddle and I? Then I could change the name to
Happy House. I don’t say that I hadn’t admired
other girls before I saw you, but since that first evening
at Uncle Pete’s I knew there never would be any
other girl for me. I was bowled over then and there
for keeps. Don’t you like me a right smart lot, Cronette?
Bless that darling little name that is all ours,
and that no one else uses. Cronette Marshall, how’s
that for a name?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Reed, you are so ridiculous,” answered Ellen,
half laughing, half crying.</p>

<p class='c009'>He moved his chair closer and took her two hands.
“Look me in the face,” he said, “and tell me truthfully
whether or not I saw something in those lovely
eyes of yours a while ago that makes me hope that
you will agree to the name of Happy House. You
and fiddle and I together, think of it, Cronette, and
don’t you know it would please Uncle Pete?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen raised her eyes shyly, but what Reed saw
there appeared to satisfy him. And then came a flurry
of opening the front door, and a crisp call of “Ellen,
come help me in with these things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen dashed out; Reed followed. “I want to help,
too,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Rindy set down a netted bag full of her purchases.
“Hello!” she said. “What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just passing by and thought I’d drop in,” answered
he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t palm off that sort of talk on me,” replied
Miss Rindy. “Come on in and give an account of
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t put me to bed, like that other time?
It’s too cold to climb out windows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I noticed you didn’t stay put long. Come in and
give an account of yourself. Has Ellen told you our
news?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and I’ve told her mine. Shall we tell her
ours, Ellen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen made no reply, but rushed out to the kitchen
with the bag and bundles. When she came back the
two were sitting on the sofa, Reed’s arm around Miss
Rindy. She looked as if she had been crying, but at
Ellen’s entrance she sat up very straight and tried to
look stern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t think you’ve stolen a march on me,
miss,” she said. “I’ve seen this coming for a long
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, have you?” exclaimed Ellen in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I have, but you are entirely too young, both
of you, to think of getting married; you not nineteen
and he only twenty-three. You must wait two or
three years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three years!” Reed looked aghast. “No home,
no friends, no Ellen. How can you, Miss Rindy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we’ll say two.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll wait till you get back from Seattle,” interposed
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you putting a premium on a long stay?”
asked Miss Rindy with a swift smile. Then, very
seriously: “You’ll take good care of her while I am
away, won’t you, Reed? The fact that you will be at
hand to watch over her makes me better satisfied to
go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bet I’ll take care of her,” returned Reed
fervently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus was Miss Rindy’s prophecy fulfilled, for the
summer saw far separated those who had roamed
Beatty’s Island together.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one day two years later, Ellen, standing at the
door of Happy House, saw a group coming across the
bridge. “Here they come! Here they come! They
caught the morning boat!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>The strains of a violin suddenly ceased, and Reed’s
long legs brought him to Ellen’s side before the travellers
came up. Mabel and her husband pressed forward,
next came Miss Rindy with her fatherless little
niece, Teresa, and then—who but Jeremy Todd?</p>

<p class='c009'>Ellen held out her hands. “Welcome to Happy
House!” she cried.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
